      CHAPTER I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is Helen in the lime-walk,&rdquo; said Mrs. Collingwood to her husband,
      as she looked out of the window. The slight figure of a young person in
      deep mourning appeared between the trees,&mdash;&ldquo;How slowly she walks! She
      looks very unhappy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Collingwood, with a sigh, &ldquo;she is young to know sorrow,
      and to struggle with difficulties to which she is quite unsuited both by
      nature and by education, difficulties which no one could ever have
      foreseen. How changed are all her prospects!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Changed indeed!&rdquo; said Mrs. Collingwood, &ldquo;pretty young creature!&mdash;Do
      you recollect how gay she was when first we came to Cecilhurst? and even
      last year, when she had hopes of her uncle&rsquo;s recovery, and when he talked
      of taking her to London, how she enjoyed the thoughts of going there! The
      world was bright before her then. How cruel of that uncle, with all his
      fondness for her, never to think what was to become of her the moment he
      was dead: to breed her up as an heiress, and leave her a beggar!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is to be done, my dear?&rdquo; said her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure I do not know; I can only feel for her, you must think for
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I think I must tell her directly of the state in which her uncle&rsquo;s
      affairs are left, and that there is no provision for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet, my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Collingwood: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean about there being
      no provision for herself, that would not strike her, but her uncle&rsquo;s
      debts,&mdash;there is the point: she would feel dreadfully the disgrace to
      his memory&mdash;she loved him so tenderly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet it must be told,&rdquo; said Mr. Collingwood, resolutely &ldquo;and perhaps it
      will be better now; she will feel it less, while her mind is absorbed by
      grief for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen was the only daughter of colonel and Lady Anne Stanley; her parents
      had both died when she was too young to know her loss, nor had she ever
      felt till now that she was an orphan, for she had been adopted and brought
      up with the greatest tenderness by her uncle, Dean Stanley, a man of
      genius, learning, and sincere piety, with the most affectionate heart, and
      a highly cultivated understanding. But on one subject he really had not
      common sense; in money matters he was inconceivably imprudent and
      extravagant; extravagant from charity, from taste, from habit. He
      possessed rich benefices in the church, and an ample private fortune, and
      it was expected that his niece would be a great heiress&mdash;he had often
      said so himself, and his fondness for her confirmed every one in this
      belief. But the dean&rsquo;s taste warred against his affection: his too
      hospitable, magnificent establishment had exceeded his income; he had too
      much indulged his passion for all the fine arts, of which he was a liberal
      patron: he had collected a magnificent library, and had lavished immense
      sums of money on architectural embellishments. Cursed with too fine a
      taste, and with too soft a heart&mdash;a heart too well knowing how to
      yield, never could he deny himself, much less any other human being, any
      gratification which money could command; and soon the necessary
      consequence was, that he had no money to command, his affairs fell into
      embarrassment&mdash;his estate was sold; but, as he continued to live with
      his accustomed hospitality and splendour, the world believed him to be as
      rich as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some rise superior from the pressure of pecuniary difficulties, but that
      was not the case with Dean Stanley, not from want of elasticity of mind;
      but perhaps because his ingenuity continually suggested resources, and his
      sanguine character led him to plunge into speculations&mdash;they failed,
      and in the anxiety and agitation which his embarrassments occasioned him,
      he fell into bad health, his physicians ordered him to Italy. Helen, his
      devoted nurse, the object upon which all his affections centered,
      accompanied him to Florence. There his health and spirits seemed at first,
      by the change of climate, to be renovated; but in Italy he found fresh
      temptations to extravagance, his learning and his fancy combined to lead
      him on from day to day to new expense, and he satisfied his conscience by
      saying to himself that all the purchases which he now made were only so
      much capital, which would, when sold in England, bring more than their
      original price, and would, he flattered himself, increase the fortune he
      intended for his niece. But one day, while he was actually bargaining for
      an antique, he was seized with a fit of apoplexy. From this fit he
      recovered, and was able to return to England with his niece. Here he found
      his debts and difficulties had been increasing; he was harassed with
      doubts as to the monied value of his last-chosen chef-d&rsquo;oeuvres; his mind
      preyed upon his weakened frame, he was seized with another fit, lost his
      speech, and, after struggles the most melancholy for Helen to see,
      conscious as she was that she could do nothing for him&mdash;he expired&mdash;his
      eyes fixed on her face, and his powerless hand held between both hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      All was desolation and dismay at the deanery; Helen was removed to the
      vicarage by the kindness of the good vicar and his wife, Mr. and Mrs.
      Collingwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was found that the dean, instead of leaving a large fortune, had
      nothing to leave. All he had laid out at the deanery was sunk and gone;
      his real property all sold; his imaginary wealth, his pictures, statues&mdash;his
      whole collection, even his books, his immense library, shrunk so much in
      value when estimated after his death, that the demands of the creditors
      could not be nearly answered: as to any provision for Miss Stanley, that
      was out of the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were the circumstances which Mrs. Collingwood feared to reveal, and
      which Mr. Collingwood thought should be told immediately to Helen; but
      hitherto she had been so much absorbed in sorrow for the uncle she had
      loved, that no one had ventured on the task.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Mr. and Mrs. Collingwood had not known her long (for they had but
      lately come to the neighbourhood), they had the greatest sympathy for her
      orphan state; and they had seen enough of her during her uncle&rsquo;s illness
      to make them warmly attached to her. Every body loved her that knew her,
      rich or poor, for in her young prosperity, from her earliest childhood,
      she had been always sweet-tempered and kind-hearted; for though she had
      been bred up in the greatest luxury, educated as heiress to a large
      fortune, taught every accomplishment, used to every fashionable
      refinement, she was not spoiled&mdash;she was not in the least selfish.
      Indeed, her uncle&rsquo;s indulgence, excessive though it was, had been always
      joined with so much affection, that it had early touched her heart, and
      filled her whole soul with ardent gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is said, that the ill men do, lives after them&mdash;the good is oft
      interred with their bones. It was not so with Dean Stanley: the good he
      had intended for Helen, his large fortune, was lost and gone; but the real
      good he had done for his niece remained in full force, and to the honour
      of his memory: the excellent education he had given her&mdash;it was
      excellent not merely in the worldly meaning of the word, as regards
      accomplishments and elegance of manners, but excellent in having given her
      a firm sense of duty, as the great principle of action, and as the guide
      of her naturally warm generous affections.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, when Helen returned from her walk, Mr. Collingwood, in the
      gentlest and kindest manner he was able, informed her of the confusion in
      her uncle&rsquo;s affairs, the debts, the impossibility of paying the creditors,
      the total loss of all fortune for herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Collingwood had well foreseen the effect this intelligence would have
      on Helen. At first, with fixed incredulous eyes, she could not believe
      that her uncle could have been in any way to blame. Twice she asked&mdash;&ldquo;Are
      you sure&mdash;are you certain&mdash;is there no mistake?&rdquo; And when the
      conviction was forced upon her, still her mind did not take in any part of
      the facts, as they regarded herself. Astonished and, shocked, she could
      feel nothing but the disgrace that would fall upon the memory of her
      beloved uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;One part of it is not true, I am certain:&rdquo; and
      hastily leaving the room, she returned immediately with a letter in her
      hand, which, without speaking, she laid before Mr. Collingwood, who wiped
      his spectacles quickly, and read.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was addressed to the poor dean, and was from an old friend of his,
      Colonel Munro, stating that he had been suddenly ordered to India, and was
      obliged to return a sum of money which the dean had many years before
      placed in his hands, to secure a provision for his niece, Miss Stanley.
    </p>
    <p>
      This letter had arrived when the dean was extremely ill. Helen had been
      afraid to give it to him, and yet thought it right to do so. The moment
      her uncle had read the letter, which he was still able to do, and to
      comprehend, though he was unable to speak, he wrote on the back with
      difficulty, in a sadly trembling hand, yet quite distinctly, these words:&mdash;&ldquo;That
      money is yours, Helen Stanley: no one has any claim upon it. When I am
      gone consult Mr. Collingwood; consider him as your guardian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Collingwood perceived that this provision had been made by the dean
      for his niece before he had contracted his present debts&mdash;many years
      before, when he had sold his paternal estate, and that knowing his own
      disposition to extravagance, he had put this sum out of his own power.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right&mdash;all right, my dear Miss Stanley,&rdquo; said the vicar; &ldquo;I am very
      glad&mdash;it is all justly yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;I shall never touch it: take it, my dear Mr.
      Collingwood, take it, and pay all the debts before any one can complain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Collingwood pressed her to him without speaking; but after a moment&rsquo;s
      recollection he replied:&mdash;&ldquo;No, no, my dear child, I cannot let you do
      this: as your guardian, I cannot allow such a young creature as you are,
      in a moment of feeling, thus to give away your whole earthly fortune&mdash;it
      must not be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must, indeed it must, my dear sir. Oh, pay everybody at once&mdash;directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not directly, at all events,&rdquo; said Mr. Collingwood&mdash;&ldquo;certainly
      not directly: the law allows a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if the money is ready,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;I cannot understand why the debt
      should not be paid at once. Is there any law against paying people
      immediately?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Collingwood half smiled, and on the strength of that half smile Helen
      concluded that he wholly yielded. &ldquo;Yes, do,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;send this money
      this instant to Mr. James, the solicitor: he knows all about it, you say,
      and he will see everybody paid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay, my dear Miss Stanley,&rdquo; said the vicar, &ldquo;I cannot consent to this,
      and you should be thankful that I am steady. If I were at this minute to
      consent, and to do what you desire&mdash;pay away your whole fortune, you
      would repent, and reproach me with my folly before the end of the year&mdash;before
      six months were over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, never,&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Collingwood strongly took her husband&rsquo;s side of the question. Helen
      could have no idea, she said, how necessary money would be to her. It was
      quite absurd to think of living upon air; could Miss Stanley think she was
      to go on in this world without money?
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen said she was not so absurd; she reminded Mrs. Collingwood that she
      should still have what had been her mother&rsquo;s fortune. Before Helen had
      well got out the words, Mrs. Collingwood replied,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will never do, you will never be able to live upon that; the
      interest of Lady Anne Stanley&rsquo;s fortune, I know what it was, would just do
      for pocket-money for you in the style of life for which you have been
      educated. Some of your uncle&rsquo;s great friends will of course invite you
      presently, and then you will find what is requisite with that set of
      people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of my uncle&rsquo;s friends perhaps will,&rdquo; said Helen; &ldquo;but I am not
      obliged to go to great or fine people, and if I cannot afford it I will
      not, for I can live independently on what I have, be it ever so little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Collingwood allowed that if Helen were to live always in the country
      in retirement, she might do upon her mother&rsquo;s fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wherever I live&mdash;whatever becomes of me, the debts must be paid&mdash;I
      will do it myself;&rdquo; and she took up a pen as she spoke&mdash;&ldquo;I will write
      to Mr. James by this day&rsquo;s post.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Surprised at her decision of manner and the firmness of one in general so
      gentle, yielding, and retired, and feeling that he had no legal power to
      resist, Mr. Collingwood at last gave way, so far as to agree that he would
      in due time use this money in satisfying her uncle&rsquo;s creditors; <i>provided
      she lived for the next six months within her income</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen smiled, as if that were a needless proviso.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I warn you,&rdquo; continued Mr. Collingwood, &ldquo;that you will most probably find
      before six months are over, that you will want some of this money to pay
      debts of your own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, no,&rdquo; cried she; &ldquo;of that there is not the slightest chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, my dear child,&rdquo; said Mrs. Collingwood, &ldquo;now that Mr. Collingwood
      has promised to do what you wish, will you do what we wish? Will you
      promise to remain with us? to live here with us, for the present at least;
      we will resign you whenever better friends may claim you, but for the
      present will you try us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try!&rdquo; in a transport of gratitude and affection she could only repeat the
      words &ldquo;Try! oh, my dear friends, how happy I am, an orphan, without a
      relation, to have such a home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But though Mr. and Mrs. Collingwood, childless as they were, felt real
      happiness in having such a companion&mdash;such an adopted daughter, yet
      they were sure that some of Dean Stanley&rsquo;s great friends and acquaintance
      in high life would ask his niece to spend the spring in town, or the
      summer in the country with them; and post after post came letters of
      condolence to Miss Stanley from all these personages of high degree,
      professing the greatest regard for their dear amiable friend&rsquo;s memory, and
      for Miss Stanley, his and their dear Helen; and these polite and kind
      expressions were probably sincere at the moment, but none of these dear
      friends seemed to think of taking any trouble on her account, or to be in
      the least disturbed by the idea of never seeing their dear Helen again in
      the course of their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen, quite touched by what was said of her uncle, thought only of him;
      but when she showed the letters to Mr. and Mrs. Collingwood, they marked
      the oversight, and looked significantly as they read, folded the letters
      up and returned them to Helen in silence. Afterwards between themselves,
      they indulged in certain comments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady C&mdash;&mdash; does not invite her, for she has too many daughters,
      and they are too ugly, and Helen is too beautiful,&rdquo; said Mrs. Collingwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady L&mdash;&mdash; has too many sons,&rdquo; said Mr. Collingwood, &ldquo;and they
      are too poor, and Helen is not an heiress now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But old Lady Margaret Dawe, who has neither sons nor daughters, what
      stands in the way there? Oh! her delicate health&mdash;delicate health is
      a blessing to some people&mdash;excuses them always from doing anything
      for anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then came many, who hoped, in general, to see Miss Stanley as soon as
      possible; and some who were &ldquo;very anxious indeed&rdquo; to have their dear Helen
      with them; but when or where never specified&mdash;and a general
      invitation, as every body knows, means nothing but &ldquo;Good morning to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Coldstream ends with, &ldquo;I forbear to say more at present,&rdquo; without
      giving any reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And here is the dean&rsquo;s dear duchess, always in the greatest haste, with
      &lsquo;You know my heart,&rsquo; in a parenthesis, &lsquo;ever and ever most sincerely and
      affec&rsquo;&mdash;yours.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the Davenants,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Collingwood, &ldquo;who were such near
      neighbours, and who were so kind to the dean at Florence; they have not
      even written!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they are at Florence still,&rdquo; said Mr. Collingwood, &ldquo;they can hardly
      have heard of the poor dean&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Davenants were the great people of this part of the country; their
      place, Cecilhurst, was close to the deanery and to the vicarage, but they
      were not known to the Collingwoods, who had come to Cecilhurst during the
      dean&rsquo;s absence abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And here is Mrs. Wilmot too,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Collingwood, &ldquo;wondering as
      usual, at everybody else, wondering that Lady Barker has not invited Miss
      Stanley to Castleport; and it never enters into Mrs. Wilmot&rsquo;s head that
      she might invite her to Wilmot&rsquo;s fort. And this is friendship, as the
      world goes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as it has been ever since the beginning of the world and will be to
      the end,&rdquo; replied Mr. Collingwood. &ldquo;Only I thought in Dean Stanley&rsquo;s case&mdash;however,
      I am glad his niece does not see it as we do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No&mdash;with all Helen&rsquo;s natural quickness of sensibility, she suspected
      nothing, saw nothing in each excuse but what was perfectly reasonable and
      kind; she was sure that her uncle&rsquo;s friends could not mean to neglect her.
      In short, she had an undoubting belief in those she loved, and she loved
      all those who she thought had loved her uncle, or who had ever shown her
      kindness. Helen had never yet experienced neglect or detected insincerity,
      and nothing in her own true and warm heart could suggest the possibility
      of double-dealing, or even of coldness in friendship. She had yet to learn
      that&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">  &ldquo;No after-friendship e&rsquo;er can raze<br />  Th&rsquo; endearments of our early days,<br />  And ne&rsquo;er the heart such fondness prove,<br />  As when it first began to love;<br />  Ere lovely nature is expelled,<br />  And friendship is romantic held.<br />  But prudence comes with hundred eyes,<br />  The veil is rent, the vision flies,<br />  The dear illusions will not last,<br />  The era of enchantment&rsquo;s past:<br />  The wild romance of life is done,<br />  The real history begun!&rdquo;<br /></pre>

      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Some time after this, Mr. Collingwood, rising from the breakfast-table,
      threw down the day&rsquo;s paper, saying there was nothing in it; Mrs.
      Collingwood glancing her eye over it exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you call this nothing? Helen, hear this!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marriage in high life&mdash;At the ambassador&rsquo;s chapel, Paris, on the
      16th instant, General Clarendon to Lady Cecilia Davenant, only daughter of
      Earl and Countess Davenant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Married! absolutely married!&rdquo; exclaimed Helen: &ldquo;I knew it was to be, but
      so soon I did not expect. Ambassador&rsquo;s chapel&mdash;where did you say?&mdash;Paris?
      No, that must be a mistake, they are all at Florence&mdash;settled there,
      I thought their letters said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Collingwood pointed to the paragraph, and Helen saw it was certainly
      Paris&mdash;there could be no mistake. Here was a full account of the
      marriage, and a list of all &ldquo;the fashionables who attended the fair bride
      to the hymeneal altar. Her father gave her away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then certainly it is so,&rdquo; said Helen; and she came to the joyful
      conclusion that they must all be on their way home:&mdash;&ldquo;Dear Lady
      Davenant coming to Cecilhurst again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia, &ldquo;the fair bride,&rdquo; had been Helen&rsquo;s most intimate friend;
      they had been when children much together, for the deanery was so close to
      Cecilhurst, that the shrubbery opened into the park. &ldquo;But is it not rather
      extraordinary, my dear. Helen,&rdquo; said Mrs. Collingwood, &ldquo;that you should
      see this account of your dear Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s marriage in the public papers
      only, without having heard of it from any of your friends themselves&mdash;not
      one letter, not one line from any of them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A cloud came over Helen&rsquo;s face, but it passed quickly, and she was sure
      they had written&mdash;something had delayed their letters. She was
      certain Lady Davenant or Lady Cecilia had written; or, if they had not, it
      was because they could not possibly, in such a hurry, such agitation as
      they must have been in. At all events, whether they had written or not,
      she was certain they could not mean anything unkind; she could not change
      her opinion of her friend for a letter more or less. &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Collingwood, &ldquo;how long is it since you have seen them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About two years; just two years it is since I parted from them at
      Florence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have corresponded with Lady Cecilia constantly ever since?&rdquo; asked
      Mrs. Collingwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not constantly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not constantly&mdash;oh!&rdquo; said Mrs. Collingwood, in a prolonged and
      somewhat sarcastic tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not constantly&mdash;so much the better,&rdquo; said her husband: &ldquo;a constant
      correspondence is always a great burthen, and moreover, sometimes a great
      evil, between young ladies especially&mdash;I hate the sight of ladies&rsquo; 
      long cross-barred letters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen said that Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s letters were never cross-barred, always
      short and far between.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem wonderfully fond of Lady Cecilia,&rdquo; said Mrs. Collingwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not wonderfully,&rdquo; replied Helen, &ldquo;but very fond, and no wonder, we were
      bred up together. And&rdquo;&mdash;continued she, after a little pause, &ldquo;and if
      Lady Cecilia had not been so generous as she is, she might have been&mdash;she
      must have been, jealous of the partiality, the fondness, which her mother
      always showed me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But was not Lady Davenant&rsquo;s heart large enough to hold two?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
      Collingwood. &ldquo;Was not she fond of her daughter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, as far as she knew her, but she did not know Lady Cecilia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not know her own daughter!&rdquo; Mr. and Mrs. Collingwood both at once
      exclaimed, &ldquo;How could that possibly be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very easily,&rdquo; Helen said, &ldquo;because she saw so little of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was not Lady Cecilia educated at home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but still Lady Cecilia, when a child, was all day long with her
      governess, and at Cecilhurst the governess&rsquo;s apartments were quite out of
      the way, in one of the wings at the end of a long corridor, with a
      separate staircase; she might as well have been in another house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad arrangement,&rdquo; said Mr. Collingwood, speaking to himself as he stood
      on the hearth. &ldquo;Bad arrangement which separates mother and daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At that time,&rdquo; continued Helen, &ldquo;there was always a great deal of company
      at Cecilhurst. Lord Davenant was one of the ministers then. I believe&mdash;I
      know he saw a great many political people, and Lady Davenant was forced to
      be always with them talking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talking! yes, yes!&rdquo; said Mr. Collingwood, &ldquo;I understand it all&mdash;Lady
      Davenant is a great politician, and female politicians, with their heads
      full of the affairs of Europe, cannot have time to think of the affairs of
      their families.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter, my dear Helen?&rdquo; said Mrs. Collingwood, taking her
      hand. Helen had tears in her eyes and looked unhappy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have done very wrong,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;I have said something that has given
      you a bad, a false opinion of one for whom I have the greatest admiration
      and love&mdash;of Lady Davenant. I am excessively sorry; I have done very
      wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the least, my dear child; you told us nothing but what everybody
      knows&mdash;that she is a great politician; you told us no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I should have told you more, and what nobody knows better than I do,&rdquo;
       cried Helen, &ldquo;that Lady Davenant is a great deal more, and a great deal
      better than a politician. I was too young to judge, you may think, but
      young as I was, I could see and feel, and children can and do often see a
      great deal into character, and I assure you Lady Davenant&rsquo;s is a sort of
      deep, high character, that you would admire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Collingwood observed with surprise, that Helen spoke of her with even
      more enthusiasm than of her dear Lady Cecilia. &ldquo;Yes, because she is a
      person more likely to excite enthusiasm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did not feel afraid of her, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not say that,&rdquo; replied Helen; &ldquo;yet it was not fear exactly, it was
      more a sort of awe, but still I liked it. It is so delightful to have
      something to look up to. I love Lady Davenant all the better, even for
      that awe I felt of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I like you all the better for everything you feel, think, and say
      about your friends,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Collingwood; &ldquo;but let us see what they
      will do; when I see whether they can write, and what they write to you, I
      will tell you more of my mind&mdash;if any letters come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If!&mdash;&rdquo; Helen repeated, but would say no more&mdash;and there it
      rested, or at least stopped. By common consent the subject was not
      recurred to for several days. Every morning at post-time Helen&rsquo;s colour
      rose with expectation, and then faded with disappointment; still, with the
      same confiding look, she said, &ldquo;I am sure it is not their fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time will show,&rdquo; said Mrs. Collingwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, one morning when she came down to breakfast, &ldquo;Triumph, my dear
      Helen!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Collingwood, holding up two large letters, all
      scribbled over with &ldquo;Try this place and try that, mis-sent to Cross-keys&mdash;Over
      moor, and heaven knows where&mdash;and&mdash;no matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen seized the packets and tore them open; one was from Paris, written
      immediately after the news of Dean Stanley&rsquo;s death; it contained two
      letters, one from Lady Davenant, the other from Lady Cecilia&mdash;&ldquo;written,
      only think!&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;how kind!&mdash;the very day before her marriage;
      signed &lsquo;Cecilia Davenant, for the last time,&rsquo;&mdash;and Lady Davenant, too&mdash;to
      think of me in all their happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She opened the other letters, written since their arrival in England, she
      read eagerly on,&mdash;then stopped, and her looks changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Davenant is not coming to Cecilhurst. Lord Davenant is to be sent
      ambassador to Petersburgh, and Lady Davenant will go along with him!&mdash;Oh!
      there is an end of everything, I shall never see her again!&mdash;Stay&mdash;she
      is to be first with Lady Cecilia at Clarendon Park, wherever that is, for
      some time&mdash;she does not know how long&mdash;she hopes to see me there&mdash;oh!
      how kind, how delightful!&rdquo; Helen put Lady Davenant&rsquo;s letter proudly into
      Mrs. Collingwood&rsquo;s hand, and eagerly opened Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So like herself! so like Cecilia,&rdquo; cried she. Mrs. Collingwood read and
      acknowledged that nothing could be kinder, for here was an invitation, not
      vague or general, but particular, and pressing as heart could wish or
      heart could make it. &ldquo;We shall be at Clarendon Park on Thursday, and shall
      expect you, dearest Helen, on Monday, just time, the general says, for an
      answer; so write and say where horses shall meet you,&rdquo; &amp;c. &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, this is being in earnest, when it comes to horses meeting,&rdquo;
       cried Mr. Collingwood. &ldquo;Of course you will go directly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen was in great agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Write&mdash;write&mdash;my dear, directly,&rdquo; said Mrs. Collingwood, &ldquo;for
      the post-boy waits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And before she had written many lines the cross-post boy sent up word that
      he could wait no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen wrote she scarcely knew what, but in short an acceptance, signed,
      sealed, delivered, and then she took breath. Off cantered the boy with the
      letters bagged, and scarcely was he out of sight, when Helen saw under the
      table the cover of the packet, in which were some lines that had not yet
      been read. They were in Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s handwriting&mdash;a postscript.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgot, dear Helen, the thing that is most essential, (you remember our
      friend Dumont&rsquo;s definition of <i>une betîse: c&rsquo;est d&rsquo;oublier la chose
      essentielle;</i>) I forgot to tell you that the general declares he will
      not hear of a mere <i>visit</i> from you. He bids me tell you that it must
      be &lsquo;till death or marriage.&rsquo; So, my dear friend, you must make up your
      mind in short to live with us till you find a General Clarendon of your
      own. To this postscript no reply&mdash;silence gives consent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had seen this!&rdquo; said Helen, as she laid it before Mr. and Mrs.
      Collingwood, &ldquo;I ought to have answered, but, indeed, I never saw it;&rdquo; she
      sprang forward instantly to ring the bell, exclaiming, &ldquo;It is time yet&mdash;stop
      the boy&mdash;&lsquo;silence gives consent.&rsquo; I must write. I cannot leave you,
      my dear friends, in this way. I did not see that postscript, believe me I
      did not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They believed her, they thanked her, but they would not let her ring the
      bell; they said she had better not bind herself in any way either to
      themselves or to Lady Cecilia. Accept of the present invitation she must&mdash;she
      must go to see her friend on her marriage; she must take leave of her dear
      Lady Davenant before her departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are older friends than we are,&rdquo; said Mr. Collingwood, &ldquo;they have the
      first claim upon you; but let us think of it as only a visit now. As to a
      residence for life, that you can best judge of for yourself after you have
      been some time at Clarendon Park; if you do not like to remain there, you
      know how gladly we shall welcome you here again, my child; or, if you
      decide to live with those you have known so long and loved so much, we
      cannot be offended at your choice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This generous kindness, this freedom from jealous susceptibility, touched
      Helen&rsquo;s heart, and increased her agitation. She could not bear the
      thoughts of either the reality or appearance of neglecting these kind good
      people, the moment she had other prospects, and frequently in all the
      hurry of her preparations, she repeated, &ldquo;It will only be a visit at
      Clarendon Park. I will return to you, I shall write to you, my dear Mrs.
      Collingwood, at all events, constantly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Collingwood gave her his parting blessing he reminded her of his
      warning about her fortune. Mrs. Collingwood reminded her of her promise to
      write. The carriage drove from the door. Helen&rsquo;s heart was full of the
      friends she was leaving, but by degrees the agitation of the parting
      subsided, her tears ceased, her heart grew lighter, and the hopes of
      seeing her friends at Clarendon Park arose bright in her mind, and her
      thoughts all turned upon Cecilia, and Lady Davenant.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Helen looked eagerly out of the carriage-window for the first view of
      Clarendon Park. It satisfied&mdash;it surpassed her expectations. It was a
      fine, aristocratic place:&mdash;ancestral trees, and a vast expanse of
      park; herds of deer, yellow and dark, or spotted, their heads appearing in
      the distance just above the fern, or grazing near, startled as the
      carriage passed. Through the long approach, she caught various views of
      the house, partly gothic, partly of modern architecture; it seemed of
      great extent and magnificence.
    </p>
    <p>
      All delightful so far; but now for her own reception. Her breath grew
      quick and quicker as she came near and nearer to the house. Some one was
      standing on the steps. Was it General Clarendon? No; only a servant. The
      carriage stopped, more servants appeared, and as Helen got out, a very
      sublime-looking personage informed her, that &ldquo;Lady Cecilia and the General
      were out riding&mdash;only in the park&mdash;would be in immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as she crossed the great hall, the same sublime person informed her
      that there would be still an hour before dinner-time, and inquired whether
      she would be pleased to be shown to her own apartment, or to the library?
      Helen felt chilled and disappointed, because this was not exactly the way
      she had expected things would be upon her arrival. She had pictured to
      herself Cecilia running to meet her in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without answering the groom of the chambers, she asked, &ldquo;Is Lady Davenant
      out too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; her ladyship is in the library.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the library then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And through the antechamber she passed rapidly, impatient of a momentary
      stop of her conductor to open the folding-doors, while a man, with a
      letter-box in hand, equally impatient, begged that Lady Davenant might be
      told, &ldquo;The General&rsquo;s express was waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Davenant was sealing letters in great haste for this express, but
      when the door opened, and she saw Helen, she threw wax and letter from
      her, and pushing aside the sofa-table, came forward to receive her with
      open arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      All was in an instant happy in Helen&rsquo;s heart; but there was the man of the
      letter-box; he must be attended to. &ldquo;Beg your pardon, Helen, my dear&mdash;one
      moment. Letters of consequence&mdash;must not be delayed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By the time the letters were finished, before they were gone, Lady Cecilia
      came in. The same as ever, with affectionate delight in her eyes&mdash;her
      beautiful eyes. The same, yes, the same Cecilia as ever; yet different:
      less of a girl, less lively, but more happy. The moment she had embraced
      her, Lady Cecilia turned quick to present General Clarendon, thinking he
      had followed, but he had stopped in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send off the letters,&rdquo; were the first words of his which Helen heard. The
      tone commanding, the voice remarkably gentlemanlike. An instant afterwards
      he came in. A fine figure, a handsome man; in the prime of life; with a
      high-born, high-bred military air. English decidedly&mdash;proudly
      English. Something of the old school&mdash;composed self-possession, with
      voluntary deference to others&mdash;rather distant. Helen felt that his
      manner of welcoming her to Clarendon Park was perfectly polite, yet she
      would have liked it better had it been less polite&mdash;more cordial.
      Lady Cecilia, whose eyes were anxiously upon her, drew her arm within
      hers, and hurried her out of the room. She stopped at the foot of the
      stairs, gathered up the folds of her riding-dress, and turning suddenly to
      Helen, said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen, my dear, you must not think <i>that</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think what?&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think <i>that</i>&mdash;for which you are now blushing. Oh, you know what
      I mean! Helen, your thoughts are just as legible in your face, as they
      always were to me. His manner is reserved&mdash;cold, may be&mdash;but not
      his heart. Understand this, pray&mdash;once for all. Do you? will you,
      dearest Helen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do, I will,&rdquo; cried Helen; and every minute she felt that she better
      understood and was more perfectly pleased with her friend. Lady Cecilia
      showed her through the apartment destined for her, which she had taken the
      greatest pleasure in arranging; everything there was not only most
      comfortable, but particularly to her taste; and some little delicate
      proofs of affection, recollections of childhood, were there;&mdash;keepsakes,
      early drawings, nonsensical things, not worth preserving, but still
      preserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look how near we are together,&rdquo; said Cecilia, opening a door into her own
      dressing-room. &ldquo;You may shut this up whenever you please, but I hope you
      will never please to do so. You see how I leave you your own free will, as
      friends usually do, with a proviso, a hope at least, that you are never to
      use it on any account&mdash;like the child&rsquo;s half guinea pocket-money,
      never to be changed.&rdquo; Her playful tone relieved, as she intended it
      should, Helen&rsquo;s too keen emotion; and this too was felt with the quickness
      with which every touch of kindness ever was felt by her. Helen pressed her
      friend&rsquo;s hand, and smiled without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were to be some time alone before the commencement of bridal visits,
      and an expected succession of troops of friends. This was a time of
      peculiar enjoyment to Helen: she had leisure to grow happy in the feeling
      of reviving hopes from old associations.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not forget her promise to write to Mrs. Collingwood; nor
      afterwards (to her credit be it here marked)&mdash;even when the house was
      full of company, and when, by amusement or by feeling, she was most
      pressed for time&mdash;did she ever omit to write to those excellent
      friends. Those who best know the difficulty will best appreciate this
      proof of the reality of her gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Lady Cecilia was a great deal with her husband riding or walking, Helen
      had opportunities of being much alone with Lady Davenant, who now gave her
      a privilege that she had enjoyed in former times at Cecilhurst, that of
      entering her apartment in the morning at all hours without fear of being
      considered an intruder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first morning, however, on seeing her ladyship immersed in papers with
      a brow of care, deeply intent, Helen paused on the threshold, &ldquo;I am afraid
      I interrupt&mdash;I am afraid I disturb you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, Helen, come in,&rdquo; cried Lady Davenant, looking up, and the face
      of care was cleared, and there was a radiance of pleasure&mdash;&ldquo;Interrupt&mdash;yes:
      disturb&mdash;no. Often in your little life, Helen, you have interrupted&mdash;never
      disturbed me. From the time you were a child till this moment, never did I
      see you come into my room without pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then sweeping away heaps of papers, she made room for Helen on the sofa
      beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now tell me how things are with you&mdash;somewhat I have heard reported
      of my friend the dean&rsquo;s affairs&mdash;tell me all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen told all as briefly as possible; she hurried on through her uncle&rsquo;s
      affairs with a tremulous voice, and before she could come to a conclusion
      Lady Davenant exclaimed,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I foresaw it long since: with all my friend&rsquo;s virtues, all his talents&mdash;but
      we will not go back upon the painful past. You, my dear Helen, have done
      just what I should have expected from you,&mdash;right;&mdash;right, too,
      the condition Mr. Collingwood has made&mdash;very right. And now to the
      next point:&mdash;where are you to live, Helen? or rather with whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen was not quite sure yet, she said she had not quite determined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to understand that your doubt lies between the Collingwoods and my
      daughter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; Cecilia most kindly invited me, but I do not know General Clarendon
      yet, and he does not know me yet. Cecilia might wish most sincerely that I
      should live with her, and I am convinced she does; but her husband must be
      considered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant&mdash;&ldquo;true; a husband is certainly a thing <i>to
      be cared for</i>&mdash;in Scottish phrase, and General Clarendon is no
      doubt a person to be considered,&mdash;but it seems that I am not a person
      to be considered in your arrangements.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even the altered, dry, and almost acrid tone in which Lady Davenant spoke,
      and the expression of disappointment in her countenance&mdash;were, as
      marks of strong affection, deeply gratifying to Helen. Lady Davenant went
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was not Cecilhurst always a home to you, Helen Stanley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&mdash;always a most happy home!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why is not Cecilhurst to be your home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Lady Davenant! how kind!&mdash;how very, very kind of you to wish
      it&mdash;but I never thought of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why did you not think of it, Helen?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean&mdash;I thought you were going to Russia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have you settled, my dear Helen,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant, smiling, &ldquo;have
      you settled that I am never to come back from Russia? Do not you know that
      you are&mdash;that you ever were&mdash;you ever will be to me a daughter?&rdquo;
       and drawing Helen fondly towards her, she added, &ldquo;as my own very dear&mdash;I
      must not say dearest child,&mdash;must not, because as I well remember
      once&mdash;little creature as you were then&mdash;-you whispered to me,
      &lsquo;Never call me dearest,&rsquo;&mdash;generous-hearted child!&rdquo; And tears started
      into her eyes as she spoke; but at that moment came a knock at the door.
      &ldquo;A packet from Lord Davenant, by Mr. Mapletofft, my lady.&rdquo; Helen rose to
      leave the room, but Lady Davenant laid a detaining hand upon her, saying,
      &ldquo;You will not be in my way in the least;&rdquo; and she opened her packet,
      adding, that while she read, Helen might amuse herself &ldquo;with arranging the
      books on that table, or in looking over the letters in that portfolio.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen had hitherto seen Lady Davenant only with the eyes of very early
      youth; but now, after an absence of two years&mdash;a great space in her
      existence, it seemed as if she looked upon her with new eyes, and every
      hour made fresh discoveries in her character. Contrary to what too often
      happens when we again see and judge of those whom we have early known,
      Lady Davenant&rsquo;s character and abilities, instead of sinking and
      diminishing, appeared to rise and enlarge, to expand and be ennobled to
      Helen&rsquo;s view. Strong lights and shades there were, but these only excited
      and fixed her attention. Even her defects&mdash;those inequalities of
      temper of which she had already had some example, were interesting as
      evidences of the power and warmth of her affections.
    </p>
    <p>
      The books on the table were those which Lady Davenant had had in her
      travelling carriage. They gave Helen an idea of the range and variety of
      the reader&rsquo;s mind. Some of them were presentation copies, as they are
      called, from several of the first authors of our own, and foreign
      countries; some with dedications to Lady Davenant; others with
      inscriptions expressing respect or propitiating favour, or anxious for
      judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The portfolio contained letters whose very signatures would have driven
      the first of modern autograph collectors distracted with joy&mdash;whose
      meanest scrap would make a scrap-book the envy of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      But among the letters in this portfolio, there were none of those nauseous
      notes of compliment, none of those epistles adulatory, degrading to those
      who write, and equally degrading to those to whom they are written:
      letters which are, however cleverly turned, inexpressibly wearisome to all
      but the parties concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      After opening and looking at the signature of several of these letters,
      Helen sat in a delightful <i>embarras de richesse</i>. To read them all&mdash;all
      at once, was impossible; with which to begin, she could not determine. One
      after another was laid aside as too good to be read first, and after
      glancing at the contents of each, she began to deal them round
      alphabetically till she was struck by a passage in one of them&mdash;she
      looked to the signature, it was unknown to fame&mdash;she read the whole,
      it was striking and interesting. There were several letters in the same
      hand, and Helen was surprised to find them arranged according to their
      dates, in Lady Davenant&rsquo;s own writing&mdash;preserved with those of
      persons of illustrious reputation! These she read on without further
      hesitation. There was no sort of affectation in them&mdash;quite easy and
      natural, &ldquo;real feeling, and genius,&rdquo; certainly genius, she thought!&mdash;and
      there seemed something romantic and uncommon in the character of the
      writer. They were signed Granville Beauclerc!
    </p>
    <p>
      Who could he be, this Granville Beauclerc? She read on till Lady Davenant,
      having finished her packet, rang a silver handbell, as was her custom, to
      summon her page. At the first tingle of the bell Helen started, and Lady
      Davenant asked, &ldquo;Whose letter, my dear, has so completely abstracted you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carlos, the page, came in at this instant, and after a quick glance at the
      handwriting of the letters, Lady Davenant gave her orders in Portuguese to
      Carlos, and then returning to Helen, took no further notice of the
      letters, but went on just where she had left off. &ldquo;Helen, I remember when
      you were about nine years old, timid as you usually were, your coming
      forward, bold as a little lion, to attack me in Cecilia&rsquo;s defence; I
      forget the particulars, but I recollect that you said I was unjust, and
      that I did not know Cecilia, and there you were right; so, to reward you,
      you shall see that now I do her perfect justice, and that I am as fond of
      her as your heart can wish. I really never did know Cecilia till I saw her
      heartily in love; I had imagined her incapable of real love; I thought the
      desire of pleasing universally had been her ruling passion&mdash;the
      ruling passion that, of a little mind and a cold heart; but I did her
      wrong. In another more material point, too, I was mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Davenant paused and looked earnestly at Helen, whose eyes said, &ldquo;I am
      glad,&rdquo; and yet she was not quite certain she knew to what she alluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cecilia righted herself, and won my good opinion, by the openness with
      which she treated me from the very commencement of her attachment to
      General Clarendon.&rdquo; Lady Davenant again paused to reflect, and played for
      some moments with the tablets in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one says that we are apt to flatter ourselves that we leave our
      faults when our faults leave us, from change of situation, age, and so
      forth; and perhaps it does not signify much which it is, if the faults are
      fairly gone, and if there be no danger of their returning: all our former
      misunderstandings arose on Cecilia&rsquo;s part from cowardice of character; on
      mine from&mdash;no matter what&mdash;no matter which of us was most
      wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, true,&rdquo; cried Helen eagerly; and anxious to prevent recurrence to
      painful recollections, she went on to ask rapidly several questions about
      Cecilia&rsquo;s marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Davenant smiled, and promised that she should have the whole history
      of the marriage in true gossip detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I wrote to you, I gave you some general ideas on the subject, but
      there are little things which could not well be written, even to so safe a
      young friend as you are, for what is written remains, and often for those
      by whom it was never intended to be seen; the <i>dessoux des cartes</i>
      can seldom be either safely or satisfactorily shown on paper, so give me
      my embroidery-frame, I never can tell well without having something to do
      with my hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as Helen set the embroidery-frame, Lady Davenant searched for some
      skeins of silk and silk winders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take these, my dear, and wind this silk for me, for I must have my hearer
      comfortably established, not like the agonised listener in the &lsquo;<i>World</i>&rsquo; 
      leaning against a table, with the corner running into him all the time.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go back,&rdquo; continued Lady Davenant, &ldquo;quite to the dark ages, the
      time when I knew nothing of my daughter&rsquo;s character but by the accidental
      lights which you afforded me. I will take up my story before the
      reformation, in the middle ages, when you and your dear uncle left us at
      Florence; about two years ago, when Cecilia was in the height of her
      conquests, about the time when a certain Colonel D&rsquo;Aubiguy flourished, you
      remember him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen answered &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; in rather a constrained voice, which caused Lady
      Davenant to look up, and on seeing that look of inquiry, Helen coloured,
      though she would have given the world not to be so foolish. The affair was
      Cecilia&rsquo;s, and Helen only wished not to have it recurred to, and yet she
      had now, by colouring, done the very thing to fix Lady Davenant&rsquo;s
      attention, and as the look was prolonged, she coloured more and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see I was wrong,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant; &ldquo;I had thought Colonel
      D&rsquo;Aubigny&rsquo;s ecstasy about that miniature of you was only a feint; but I
      see he really was an admirer of yours, Helen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of mine! oh no, never!&rdquo; Still from her fear of saying something that
      should implicate Cecilia, her tone, though she spoke exactly the truth,
      was not to Lady Davenant&rsquo;s discriminative ear quite natural&mdash;Helen
      seeing doubt, added,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible, my dear Lady Davenant! you know I was then so young, quite a
      child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, not quite; two from eighteen and sixteen remain, I think, and in
      our days sixteen is not absolutely a child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen made no answer; her thoughts had gone back to the time when Colonel
      D&rsquo;Aubigny was first introduced to her, which was just before her uncle&rsquo;s
      illness, and when her mind had been so engrossed by him, that she had but
      a confused recollection of all the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you are right, my dear,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant; &ldquo;right to be absolutely
      silent. In difficult cases say nothing; but still you are wrong in sitting
      so uneasily under it, for that seems as if there <i>was</i> something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing upon earth!&rdquo; cried Helen, &ldquo;if you would not look at me <i>so</i>,
      my clear Lady Davenant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, my dear Helen, do not break my embroidery silk; that jerk was
      imprudent, and trust me, my dear, the screw of that silk winder is not so
      much to blame as you would have me think; take patience with yourself and
      with me. There is no great harm done, no unbearable imputation, you are
      not accused of loving or liking, only of having been admired.&rdquo; &ldquo;Never!&rdquo;
       cried Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well! it does not signify in the least now; the man is either dying
      or dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad of it,&rdquo; cried Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How barbarous!&rdquo; said Lady Davenant, &ldquo;but let it pass, I am neither glad
      nor sorry; contempt is more dignified and safer than hatred, my dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now to return to Cecilia; soon after, I will not say the D&rsquo;Aubigny era,
      but soon after you left us, I fell sick, Cecilia was excessively kind to
      me. In kindness her affectionate heart never failed, and I felt this the
      more, from a consciousness that I had been a little harsh to her. I
      recovered but slowly; I could not bear to have her confined so long in a
      sick room, and yet I did not much like either of the chaperons with whom
      she went out, though they were both of rank, and of unimpeachable
      character&mdash;the one English, one of the best women in the world, but
      the most stupid; the other a foreigner, one of the most agreeable women in
      the world, but the most false. I prevailed on Cecilia to break off that&mdash;I
      do not know what to call it, friendship it was not, and my daughter and I
      drew nearer together. Better times began to dawn, but still there was
      little sympathy between us; my mind was intent on Lord Davenant&rsquo;s
      interests, hers on amusement and admiration. Her conquests were numerous,
      and she gloried in their number, for, between you and me, Cecilia was,
      before the reformation, not a little of a coquette. You will not allow it,
      you did not see it, you did not go out with her, and being three or four
      years younger, you could not be a very good critic of Cecilia&rsquo;s conduct;
      and depend upon it I am right, she was not a little of a coquette. She did
      not know, and I am sure I did not know, that she had a heart, till she
      became acquainted with General Clarendon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first time we met him,&rdquo;&mdash;observing a quickening of attention in
      Helen&rsquo;s eyes, Lady Davenant smiled, and said, &ldquo;Young ladies always like to
      hear of &lsquo;the first time we saw him.&rsquo;&mdash;The first time we saw General
      Clarendon was&mdash;forgive me the day of the month&mdash;in the gallery
      at Florence. I forget how it happened that he had not been presented to me&mdash;to
      Lord Davenant he must have been. But so it was and it was new to Cecilia
      to see a man of his appearance who had not on his first arrival shown
      himself ambitious to be made known to her. He was admiring a beautiful
      Magdalene, and he was standing with his back towards us. I recollect that
      his appearance when I saw him as a stranger&mdash;the time when one can
      best judge of appearance&mdash;struck me as that of a distinguished
      person; but little did I think that there stood Cecilia&rsquo;s husband! so
      little did my maternal instinct guide me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As we approached, he turned and gave one look at Cecilia; she gave one
      look at him. He passed on, she stopped me to examine the picture which he
      had been admiring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every English mother at Florence, except myself, had their eyes fixed
      upon General Clarendon from the moment of his arrival. But whatever I may
      have been, or may have been supposed to be, on the great squares of
      politics, I believe I never have been accused or even suspected of being a
      manoeuvrer on the small domestic scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My reputation for imbecility in these matters was perhaps advantageous.
      He did not shun me as he did the tribe of knowing ones; a hundred reports
      flew about concerning him, settling in one, that he was resolved never to
      marry. Yet he was a passionate admirer of beauty and grace, and it was
      said that he had never been unsuccessful where he had wished to please.
      The secret of his resolution against marriage was accounted for by the
      gossiping public in many ways variously absurd. The fact was, that in his
      own family, and in that of a particular friend, there had been about this
      time two or three scandalous intrigues, followed by &lsquo;the public brand of
      shameful life.&rsquo; One of these &lsquo;sad affairs,&rsquo; as they are styled, was marked
      with premeditated treachery and turpitude. The lady had been, or had
      seemed to be, for years a pattern wife, the mother of several children;
      yet she had long betrayed, and at last abandoned, a most amiable and
      confiding husband, and went off with a man who did not love her, who cared
      for nought but himself, a disgusting monster of selfishness, vanity, and
      vice! This woman was said to have been once good, but to have been
      corrupted and depraved by residence abroad&mdash;by the contagion of
      foreign profligacy. In the other instance, the seduced wife had been
      originally most amiable, pure-minded, uncommonly beautiful, loved to
      idolatry by her husband, Clarendon&rsquo;s particular friend, a man high in
      public estimation. The husband shot himself. The seducer was, it&rsquo;s said,
      the lady&rsquo;s first love. That these circumstances should have made a deep
      impression on Clarendon, is natural; the more feeling&mdash;the stronger
      the mind, the more deep and lasting it was likely to be. Besides his
      resolution against marriage in general, we heard that he had specially
      resolved against marrying any travelled lady, and most especially against
      any woman with whom there was danger of a first love. How this danger was
      to be avoided or ascertained, mothers and daughters looked at one another,
      and did not ask, or at least did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cecilia, apparently unconcerned, heard and laughed at these high
      resolves, after her gay fashion with her young companions, and marvelled
      how long the resolution would be kept. General Clarendon of course could
      not but be introduced to us, could not but attend our assemblies, nor
      could he avoid meeting us in all the good English and foreign society at
      Florence; but whenever he met us, he always kept at a safe distance: this
      caution marked his sense of danger. To avoid its being so construed,
      perhaps, he made approaches to me, politely cold; we talked very wisely on
      the state of the Continent and the affairs of Europe; I did not, however,
      confine myself or him to politics, I gave him many unconscious
      opportunities of showing in conversation, not his abilities, for they are
      nothing extraordinary; but his character, which is first-rate. Gleams came
      out, of a character born to subjugate, to captivate, to attach for life.
      It worked first on Cecilia&rsquo;s curiosity; she thought she was only curious,
      and she listened at first, humming an opera air between times, with the
      least concerned look conceivable. But, her imagination was caught, and it
      thenceforward through every thing that every body else might be saying,
      and through all she said herself, she heard every word that fell from our
      general, and even all that was repeated of his saying at second or third
      hand. So she learned in due season that he had seen women as handsome,
      handsomer than Lady Cecilia Davenant; but that there was something in her
      manner peculiarly suited to his taste&mdash;his fastidious taste! so free
      from coquetry, he said she was. And true, perfectly true, from the time he
      became acquainted with her; no hypocrisy on her part, no mistake on his;
      at the first touch of a real love, there was an end of vanity and
      coquetry. Then her deference&mdash;her affection for her mother, was so
      charming, he thought; such perfect confidence&mdash;such quick
      intelligence between us. No deceit here either, only a little
      self-deception on Cecilia&rsquo;s part. She had really grown suddenly fonder of
      me; what had become of her fear, she did not know. But I knew full well my
      new charm and my real merit; I was a good and safe conductor of the
      electric shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It chanced one day, when I was listening only as one listens to a man who
      is talking at another through oneself, I did not immediately catch the
      meaning, or I believe hear what the general said. Cecilia, unawares,
      answered for me, and showed that she perfectly understood:&mdash;he bowed&mdash;she
      blushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man is usually quicksighted to woman&rsquo;s blushes. But our general was not
      vain, only proud; the blush he did not set down to his own account, but
      very much to hers. It was a proof, he thought, of so much simplicity of
      heart, so unspoiled by the world, so unlike&mdash;in short, so like the
      very woman he had painted in his fancy, before he knew too much&mdash;&mdash;.
      Lady Cecilia was now a perfect angel. Not one word of all this did he say,
      but it was understood quite as well as if it had been spoken: his lips
      were firm compressed, and the whole outer man composed&mdash;frigidly
      cold;&mdash;yet through all this Cecilia saw&mdash;such is woman&rsquo;s
      penetration in certain cases&mdash;Cecilia saw what must sooner or later
      happen. He, still proud of his prudence, refrained from word, look, or
      sigh, resolved to be impassive till his judgment should be perfectly
      satisfied. At last this judgment was perfectly satisfied; that is, he was
      passionately in love&mdash;fairly &lsquo;caught,&rsquo; my dear, &lsquo;in the strong toils
      of grace,&rsquo; and he threw himself at Cecilia&rsquo;s feet. She was not quite so
      much surprised as he expected, but more pleased than he had ventured to
      hope. There was that, however, in his proud humility, which told Cecilia
      there must be no trifling.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">  &lsquo;He either fears his fate too much,<br />  Or his deserts are small,<br />  Who fears to put it to the touch,<br />  To win or lose it all.&lsquo;<br /></pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He put it to the test, and won it all. General Clarendon, indeed, is a
      man likely to win and keep the love of woman, for this, among other good
      reasons, that love and honour being with him inseparable, the idol he
      adores must keep herself at the height to which he has raised her, or
      cease to receive his adoration. She must be no common vulgar idol for
      every passing worshipper.&rdquo; As Lady Davenant paused, Helen looked up,
      hesitated, and said: &ldquo;I hope that General Clarendon is not disposed to
      jealousy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No: he&rsquo;s too proud to be jealous,&rdquo; replied Lady Davenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Are proud men never jealous? thought Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; continued Lady Davenant, &ldquo;that General Clarendon is too proud to
      be jealous of his wife. For aught I know, he might have felt jealousy of
      Cecilia before she was his, for then she was but a woman, like another;
      but once HIS&mdash;once having set his judgment on the cast, both the
      virtues and the defects of his character join in security for his perfect
      confidence in the wife &lsquo;his choice and passion both approve.&rsquo; From temper
      and principle he is unchangeable. I acknowledge that I think the general
      is a little inclined perhaps to obstinacy; but, as Burke says, though
      obstinacy is certainly a vice, it happens that the whole line of the great
      and masculine virtues, constancy, fidelity, fortitude, magnanimity, are
      closely allied to this disagreeable quality, of which we have so just an
      abhorrence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is most peculiarly happy for Cecilia that she has a husband of this
      firm character, one on whom she can rely&mdash;one to whom she may, she
      must, look up, if not always, yet upon all important occasions where
      decision is necessary, or integrity required. It is between her and her
      general as it should be in marriage, each has the compensating qualities
      to those which the other possesses: General Clarendon is inferior to
      Cecilia in wit, but superior in judgment; inferior in literature, superior
      in knowledge of the world; inferior to my daughter altogether in
      abilities, in what is called genius, but far superior in that ruling
      power, <i>strength of mind</i>. Strength of mind is an attaching as well
      as a ruling power: all human creatures, women especially, become attached
      to those who have power over their minds. Yes, Helen, I am satisfied with
      their marriage, and with your congratulations: yours are the sort I like.
      Vulgar people&mdash;by vulgar people I mean all who think vulgarly&mdash;very
      great vulgar people have congratulated me upon this establishment of my
      daughter&rsquo;s fortune and future rank (a dukedom in view), all that could be
      wished in worldly estimation. But I rejoice in it as the security for my
      daughter&rsquo;s character and happiness. Thank you again, my dear young friend,
      for your sympathy; you can understand me, you can feel with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sympathy, intelligent, quick, warm, unwearied, unweariable, such as
      Helen&rsquo;s, is really a charming accomplishment in a friend; the only
      obligation a proud person, is never too proud to receive; and it was most
      gratifying to Helen to be allowed to sympathise with Lady Davenant&mdash;one
      who, in general, never spoke of herself, or unveiled her private feelings,
      even to those who lived with her on terms of intimacy. Helen felt
      responsible for the confidence granted to her thus upon credit, and a
      strong ambition was excited in her mind to justify the high opinion her
      superior friend had formed of her. She determined to become all that she
      was believed to be; as the flame of a taper suddenly rises towards what is
      held over it, her spirit mounted to the point to which her friend pointed.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Helen&rsquo;s perfect happiness at Clarendon Park was not of long duration.
      People who have not been by nature blessed or cursed with nice feelings,
      or who have well rubbed off their delicacy in roughing through the world,
      can be quite happy, or at least happy enough without ascertaining whether
      they are really esteemed or liked by those with whom they live. Many, and
      some of high degree, when well sheltered and fed, and provided with all
      the necessaries, and surrounded by all the luxuries of life, and with
      appearances tolerably well kept up by outward manner, care little or
      nought about the inside sentiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Helen was neither of the case-hardened philosophic, or the naturally
      obtuse-feeling class; she belonged to the over-anxious. Surrounded at
      Clarendon Park with all the splendour of life, and with the immediate
      expectation of seeing and being seen by the first society in England; with
      the certainty also of being tenderly loved and highly esteemed by two of
      the persons she was living with, yet a doubt about the third began to make
      her miserable. Whether General Clarendon really liked her or not, was a
      question that hung upon her mind sometimes as a dead weight&mdash;then
      vibrating backwards and forwards, she often called to mind, and
      endeavoured to believe, what Cecilia the first day told her, that this
      reserved manner was natural to him with strangers, and would wear off. But
      to her the icy coldness did not thaw. So she felt, or so she fancied, and
      which it was she could not decide. She had never before lived with any one
      about whose liking for her she could doubt, therefore, as she said to
      herself, &ldquo;I know I am a bad judge.&rdquo; She feared to open her mind to
      Cecilia. Lady Davenant would be the safest person to consult; yet Helen,
      with all her young delicacy fresh about her, scrupled, and could not screw
      her courage to the sticking-place. Every morning going to Lady Davenant&rsquo;s
      room, she half resolved and yet came away without speaking. At last, one
      morning, she began:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said something the other day, my dear Lady Davenant, about a visit
      from Miss Clarendon. Perhaps&mdash;I am afraid&mdash;in short I think,&mdash;I
      fear, the general does not like my being here; and I thought, perhaps, he
      was displeased at his sister&rsquo;s not being here,&mdash;that he thought
      Cecilia&rsquo;s having asked me prevented his sister&rsquo;s coming; but then you told
      me he was not of a jealous temper, did not you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Distinguez</i>,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant; &ldquo;<i>distinguons</i>, as the old
      French metaphysicians used to say, <i>distinguons</i>, there be various
      kinds of jealousy, as of love. The old romancers make a distinction
      between <i>amour</i> and <i>amour par amours</i>. Whatever that mean, I
      beg leave to take a distinction full as intelligible, I trust, between <i>jalousie
      par amour</i> and <i>jalousie par amitié</i>. Now, to apply; when I told
      you that our general was not subject to jealousy, I should have
      distinguished, and said, <i>jalousie par amour</i>&mdash;jealousy in love,
      but I will not ensure him against <i>jalousie par amitié</i>&mdash;jealousy
      in friendship&mdash;of friends and relations, I mean. Me-thinks I have
      seen symptoms of this in the general, he does not like my influence over
      Cecilia, nor yours, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand it all,&rdquo; exclaimed Helen, &ldquo;and I was right from the very
      first; I saw he disliked me, and he ever will and must dislike and detest
      me&mdash;I see it in every look, hear it in every word, in every tone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, my dear Helen, if you are riding off on your imagination, I wish you
      a pleasant ride, and till you come back again I will write my letter,&rdquo;
       said Lady Davenant, taking up a pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen begged pardon, and protested she was not going to ride off upon any
      imagination,&mdash;she had no imagination now&mdash;she entreated Lady
      Davenant to go on, for she was very anxious to know the whole truth,
      whatever it might be. Lady Davenant laid down her pen, and told her all
      she knew. In the first place, that Cecilia did not like Miss Clarendon,
      who, though a very estimable person, had a sort of uncompromising
      sincerity, joined with a <i>brusquerie</i> of manner which Cecilia could
      not endure. How her daughter had managed matters to refuse the sister
      without offending the brother, Lady Davenant said she did not know; that
      was Cecilia&rsquo;s secret, and probably it lay in her own charming manner of
      doing things, aided by the whole affair having occurred a few days before
      marriage, when nothing could be taken ill of the bride elect. &ldquo;The
      general, as Cecilia told me, desired that she would write to invite you,
      Helen; she did so, and I am very glad of it. This is all I know of this
      mighty matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Helen could not endure the idea of being there, contrary to the
      general&rsquo;s wishes, in the place of the sister he loved. Oh, how very, very
      unfortunate she was to have all her hopes blighted, destroyed&mdash;and
      Cecilia&rsquo;s kindness all in vain. Dear, dear Cecilia!&mdash;but for the
      whole world Helen would not be so selfish&mdash;she would not run the
      hazard of making mischief. She would never use her influence over Cecilia
      in opposition to the general. Oh, how little he knew of her character, if
      he thought it possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen had now come to tears. Then the keen sense of injustice turned to
      indignation; and the tears wiped away, and pride prevailing, colouring she
      exclaimed, &ldquo;That she knew what she ought to do, she knew what she would do&mdash;she
      would not stay where the master of the house did not wish for her. Orphan
      though she was, she could not accept of protection or obligation from any
      human being who neither liked or esteemed her. She would shorten her visit
      at Clarendon Park&mdash;make it as short as his heart could desire,&mdash;she
      would never be the cause of any disagreement&mdash;poor, dear, kind
      Cecilia! She would write directly to Mrs. Collingwood.&rdquo; At the close of
      these last incoherent sentences, Helen was awe-struck by the absolute
      composed immovability and silence of Lady Davenant. Helen stood rebuked
      before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Instead of writing to Mrs. Collingwood, had not you better go at once?&rdquo;
       said her ladyship, speaking in a voice so calm, and in a tone so slightly
      ironical, that it might have passed for earnest on any but an acutely
      feeling ear&mdash;&ldquo;Shall I ring, and order your carriage?&rdquo; putting her
      hand on the bell as she spoke, and resting it there, she continued&mdash;&ldquo;It
      would be so spirited to be off instantly; so wise, so polite, so
      considerate towards <i>dear</i> Cecilia&mdash;so dignified towards the
      general, and so kind towards me, who am going to a far country, Helen, and
      may perhaps not see you ever again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me!&rdquo; cried Helen; &ldquo;I never could go while you were here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not know what you might think proper when you seemed to have lost
      your senses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have recovered them,&rdquo; said Helen; &ldquo;I will do whatever you please&mdash;whatever
      you think best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must not be what I please, my dear child, nor what I think best, but
      what you judge for yourself to be best; else what will become of you when
      I am in Russia? It must be some higher and more stable principle of action
      that must govern you. It must not be the mere wish to please this or that
      friend;&mdash;the defect of your character, Helen, remember I tell you, is
      this&mdash;inordinate desire to be loved, this impatience of not being
      loved&mdash;that which but a moment ago made you ready to abandon two of
      the best friends you have upon earth, because you imagine, or you suspect,
      or you fear, that a third person, almost a stranger, does not like before
      he has had time to know you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was very foolish,&rdquo; said Helen; &ldquo;but now I will be wise, I will do
      whatever is&mdash;right. Surely you would not have me live here if I were
      convinced that the master of the house did not wish it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not&mdash;certainly not,&rdquo; repeated Lady Davenant; &ldquo;but let us
      see our way before us; never gallop, my dear, much less leap; never move,
      till you see your way;&mdash;once it is ascertained that General Clarendon
      does not wish you to be here, nor approve of you for the chosen companion
      of his wife, I, as your best friend, would say, begone, and speed you on
      your way; then as much pride, as much spirit as you will; but those who
      are conscious of possessing real spirit, should never be&mdash;seldom are&mdash;in
      a hurry to show it; that kind of ostentatious haste is undignified in man,
      and ungraceful in woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen promised that she would be patience itself: &ldquo;But tell me exactly,&rdquo;
       said she, &ldquo;what you would have me do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing! that is easy at least,&rdquo; said Helen, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not so easy as you imagine; it requires sometimes no small share of
      strength of mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strength of mind!&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;I am afraid I have not any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Acquire it then, my dear,&rdquo; said her friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But can I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; strength of mind, like strength of body, is improved by
      exercise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had any to begin with&mdash;&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have some, Helen, a great deal in one particular, else why should I
      have any more regard for you, or more hope of you, than of any other
      well-dressed, well-taught beauty, any of the tribe of young ladies who
      pass before me without ever fixing my mind&rsquo;s eye for one moment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But in what particular, my dear Lady Davenant, do you mean?&rdquo; said Helen,
      anxiously; &ldquo;I am afraid you are mistaken; in what do you think I ever
      showed strength of mind? Tell me, and I will tell you the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you will, and there is the point that I mean. Ever since I have
      known you, you have always, as at this moment, coward as you are, been
      brave enough to speak the truth; and truth I believe to be the only real
      lasting foundation for friendship; in all but truth there is a principle
      of decay and dissolution. Now good bye, my dear;&mdash;stay, one word more&mdash;there
      is a line in some classic poet, which says &lsquo;the suspicion of ill-will
      never fails to produce it&rsquo;&mdash;Remember this in your intercourse with
      General Clarendon; show no suspicion of his bearing you ill-will, and to
      show none, you must feel none. Put absolutely out of your head all that
      you may have heard or imagined about Miss Clarendon, or her brother&rsquo;s
      prejudices on her account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will&mdash;I will indeed,&rdquo; said Helen, and so they parted. A few words
      have sometimes a material influence on events in human life. Perhaps even
      among those who hold in general that advice never does good, there is no
      individual who cannot recollect some few words&mdash;some conversation
      which has altered the future colour of their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen&rsquo;s over-anxiety concerning General Clarendon&rsquo;s opinion of her, being
      now balanced by the higher interest Lady Davenant had excited, she met him
      with new-born courage; and Lady Cecilia, not that she suspected it was
      necessary, but merely by way of prevention, threw in little douceurs of
      flattery, on the general&rsquo;s part, repeated sundry pretty compliments, and
      really kind things which he had said to her of Helen. These always pleased
      Helen at the moment, but she could never make what she was told he said of
      her quite agree with what he said to her: indeed, he said so very little,
      that no absolute discrepancy could be detected between the words spoken
      and the words reported to have been said; but still the looks did not
      agree with the opinions, or the cordiality implied.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning Lady Cecilia told her that the general wished that she would
      ride out with them, &ldquo;and you must come, indeed you must, and try his
      pretty Zelica; he wishes it of all things, he told me so last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general chancing to come in as she spoke, Lady Cecilia appealed to him
      with a look that almost called upon him to enforce her request; but he
      only said that if Miss Stanley would do him the honour, he should
      certainly be happy, if Zelica would not be too much for her; but he could
      not take it upon him to advise. Then looking for some paper of which he
      came in search, and passing her with the most polite and deferential
      manner possible, he left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half vexed, half smiling, Helen looked at Cecilia, and asked whether all
      she had told her was not a little&mdash;&ldquo;<i>plus belle que la vérité.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia, blushing slightly, poured out rapid protestations that all
      she had ever repeated to Helen of the general&rsquo;s sayings was perfect truth&mdash;&ldquo;I
      will not swear to the words&mdash;because in the first place it is not
      pretty to swear, and next, because I can never recollect anybody&rsquo;s words,
      or my own, five minutes after they have been said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Partly by playfulness, and partly by protestations, Lady Cecilia half
      convinced Helen; but from this time she refrained from repeating
      compliments which, true or false, did no good, and things went on better;
      observing this, she left them to their natural course, upon all such
      occasions the best way.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now visitors began to appear, and some officers of the general&rsquo;s staff
      arrived. Clarendon Park happened to be in the district which General
      Clarendon commanded, so that he was able usually to reside there. It was
      in what is called a good neighbourhood, and there was much visiting, and
      many entertainments.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day at dinner, Helen was seated between the general and a fine young
      guardsman, who, as far as his deep sense of his own merit, and his
      fashionable indifference to young ladies would permit, had made some
      demonstrations of a desire to attract her notice. He was piqued when, in
      the midst of something he had wonderfully exerted himself to say, he
      observed that her attention was distracted by a gentleman opposite, who
      had just returned from the Continent, and who, among other pieces of news,
      marriages and deaths of English abroad, mentioned that &ldquo;poor D&rsquo;Aubigny&rdquo;
       was at last dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen looked first at Cecilia, who, as she saw, heard what was said with
      perfect composure; and then at Lady Davenant, who had meantime glanced
      imperceptibly at her daughter, and then upon Helen, whose eyes she met&mdash;and
      Helen coloured merely from association, because she had coloured before&mdash;provoking!
      yet impossible to help it. All passed in less time than it can be told,
      and Helen had left the guardsman in the midst of his sentence,
      discomfited, and his eyes were now upon her; and in confusion she turned
      from him, and there were the general&rsquo;s eyes but he was only inviting her
      to taste some particular wine, which he thought she would like, and which
      she willingly accepted, and praised, though she assuredly did not know in
      the least what manner of taste it had. The general now exerted himself to
      occupy the guardsman in a conversation about promotion, and drew all
      observation from Helen. Yet not the slightest indication of having seen,
      heard, or understood, appeared in his countenance, not the least curiosity
      or interest about Colonel D&rsquo;Aubigny. Of one point Helen was however
      intuitively certain, that he had noticed that confusion which he had so
      ably, so coolly covered. One ingenuous look from her thanked him, and his
      look in return was most gratifying; she could not tell how it was, but it
      appeared more as if he understood and liked her than any look she had ever
      seen from him before. They were both more at their ease. Next day, he
      certainly justified all Cecilia&rsquo;s former assurances, by the urgency with
      which he desired to have her of the riding party. He put her on horseback
      himself, bade the aide-de-camp ride on with Lady Cecilia&mdash;three
      several times set the bridle right in Miss Stanley&rsquo;s hand, assuring her
      that she need not be afraid, that Zelica was the gentlest creature
      possible, and he kept his fiery horse, Fleetfoot, to a pace that suited
      her during the whole time they were out. Helen took courage, and her ride
      did her a vast deal of good.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rides were repeated, the general evidently became more and more
      interested about Miss Stanley; he appealed continually to her taste, and
      marked that he considered her as part of his family; but, as Helen told
      Lady Davenant, it was difficult, with a person of his high-bred manners
      and reserved temper, to ascertain what was to be attributed to general
      deference to her sex, what to particular regard for the individual, how
      much to hospitality to his guest, or attention to his wife&rsquo;s friend, and
      what might be considered as proof of his own desire to share that
      friendship, and of a real wish that she should continue to live with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      While she was in this uncertainty, Lord Davenant arrived from London; he
      had always been fond of Helen, and now the first sight of her youthful
      figure in deep mourning, the recollection of the great changes that had
      taken place since they had last met, touched him to the heart&mdash;he
      folded her in his arms, and was unable to speak. He! a great bulky man,
      with a face of constitutional joy&mdash;but so it was; he had a tender
      heart, deep feelings of all kinds under an appearance of <i>insouciance</i>
      which deceived the world. He was distinguished as a political leader&mdash;but,
      as he said of himself, he had been three times inoculated with ambition&mdash;once
      by his mother, once by his brother, and once by his wife; but it had never
      taken well; the last the best, however,&mdash;it had shown at least
      sufficiently to satisfy his friends, and he was happy to be no more
      tormented. With talents of the first order, and integrity unblenching, his
      character was not of that stern stuff&mdash;no, not of that corrupt stuff&mdash;of
      which modern ambition should be made.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had now something to tell Helen, which he would say even before he
      opened his London budget of news. He told her, with a congratulatory
      smile, that he had had an opportunity of showing his sense of Mr.
      Collingwood&rsquo;s merits; and as he spoke he put a letter into her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter was from her good friend Mr. Collingwood, accepting a bishopric
      in the West Indies, which had been offered to him by Lord Davenant. It
      enclosed a letter for Helen, desiring in the most kind manner that she
      would let him know immediately and decidedly where and with whom she
      intended to live; and there was a postscript from Mrs. Collingwood full of
      affection, and doubts, and hopes, and fears.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment Helen had finished this letter, without seeming to regard the
      inquiring looks of all present, and without once looking towards any one
      else, she walked deliberately up to General Clarendon, and begged to speak
      to him alone. Never was general more surprised, but of course he was too
      much of a general to let that appear. Without a word, he offered his arm,
      and led her to his study; he drew a chair towards her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No misfortune, I hope, Miss Stanley? If I can in any way be of service&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only service, General Clarendon,&rdquo; said Helen, her manner becoming
      composed, and her voice steadying as she went on&mdash;&ldquo;the only service
      you can do me now is to tell me the plain truth, and this will prevent
      what would certainly be a misfortune to me&mdash;perhaps to all of us.
      Will you read this letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He received it with an air of great interest, and again moved the chair to
      her. Before she sat down, she added,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am unused to the world, you see, General Clarendon. I have been
      accustomed to live with one who always told me his mind sincerely, so that
      I could judge always what I ought to do. Will you do so now? It is the
      greatest service, as well as favour, you can do me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Depend upon it, I will,&rdquo; said General Clarendon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not ask you to tell me in words&mdash;that might be painful to
      your politeness; only let me see it,&rdquo; said Helen, and she sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general read on without speaking, till he came to the mention of
      Helen&rsquo;s original promise of living with the Collingwoods. He did not
      comprehend that passage, he said, showing it to her. He had always, on the
      contrary, understood that it had been a long <i>settled</i> thing, a
      promise between Miss Stanley and Lady Cecilia, that Helen should live with
      Lady Cecilia when she married.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No such thing!&rdquo; Helen said. &ldquo;No such agreement had ever been made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the general now perceived; but this was a mistake of his which he hoped
      would make no difference in her arrangements, he said: &ldquo;Why should it?&mdash;unless
      Miss Stanley felt unhappy at Clarendon Park?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and Helen was silent: then, taking desperate resolution, she
      answered,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be perfectly happy here, if I were sure of your wishes, your
      feelings about me&mdash;about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible that there has been any thing in my manner,&rdquo; said he,
      &ldquo;that could give Miss Stanley pain? What could have put a doubt into her
      mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There might be some other person nearer, and naturally dearer to you,&rdquo;
       said Helen, looking up in his face ingenuously&mdash;&ldquo;one whom you might
      have desired to have in my place:&mdash;your sister, Miss Clarendon, in
      short.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Cecilia tell you of this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Lady Davenant did; and since I heard it I never could be happy&mdash;I
      never can be happy till I know your feeling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His manner instantly changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall know my feelings, then,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Till I knew you, Helen, my
      wish was, that my sister should live with my wife; now I know you, my wish
      is, that you should live with us. You will suit Cecilia better than my
      sister could&mdash;will suit us both better, having the same truth of
      character, and more gentleness of manner. I have answered you with
      frankness equal to your own. And now,&rdquo; said he, taking her hand, &ldquo;you know
      Cecilia has always considered you as her sister&mdash;allow me to do the
      same: consider me as a brother&mdash;such you shall find me. Thank you.
      This is settled for life,&rdquo; added he, drawing her arm through his, and
      taking up her letters, he led her back towards the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      But her emotion, the stronger for being suppressed, was too great for
      re-appearing in company: she withdrew her arm from his when they were
      passing through the hall, and turning her face away, she had just voice
      enough to beg he would show her letters to&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He understood. She ran up-stairs to her own room, glad to be alone; a
      flood of joy came over her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A brother in Cecilia&rsquo;s husband!&mdash;a brother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The word had a magical charm, and she could not help repeating it aloud&mdash;she
      wept like a child. Lady Cecilia soon came flying in, all delight and
      affection, reproaches and wonder alternately, in the quickest conceivable
      succession. &ldquo;Delighted, it is settled and for ever! my dear, dear Helen!
      But how could you ever think of leaving us, you wicked Helen! Well! now
      you see what Clarendon really is! But, my dear, I was so terrified when I
      heard it all. You are, and ever were, the oddest mixture of cowardice and
      courage. I&mdash;do you know I, brave <i>I</i>&mdash;never should have
      advised&mdash;never should have ventured as you have? But he is delighted
      at it all, and so am I now it has all ended so charmingly, now I have you
      safe. I will write to the Collingwoods; you shall not have a moment&rsquo;s
      pain; I will settle it all, and invite them here before they leave
      England; Clarendon desired I would&mdash;oh, he is!&mdash;now you will
      believe me! The Collingwoods, too, will be glad to be asked here to take
      leave of you, and all will be right; I love, as you do, dear Helen, that
      everybody should be pleased when I am happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Lady Davenant heard all that had passed, she did not express that
      prompt unmixed delight which Helen expected; a cloud came over her brow,
      something painful regarding her daughter seemed to strike her, for her
      eyes fixed on Cecilia, and her emotion was visible in her countenance; but
      pleasure unmixed appealed as she turned to Helen, and to her she gave,
      what was unusual, unqualified approbation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Helen, I admire your plain straightforward truth; I am satisfied
      with this first essay of your strength of mind and courage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Courage!&rdquo; said Helen, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not such as is required to take a lion by the beard, or a bull by the
      horns,&rdquo; replied Lady Davenant; &ldquo;but there are many persons in this world
      who, brave though they be, would rather beard a lion, sooner seize a bull
      by the horns, than, when they get into a dilemma, dare to ask a direct
      question, and tell plainly what passes in their own minds. Moral courage
      is, believe me, uncommon in both sexes, and yet in going through the world
      it is equally necessary to the virtue of both men and women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do you really think,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;that strength of mind, or what you
      call moral courage, is as necessary to women as it is to men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, show me a virtue, male or female&mdash;if virtues admit of
      grammatical distinctions, if virtues acknowledge the more worthy gender
      and the less worthy of the grammar, show me a virtue male or female that
      <i>can</i> long exist without truth. Even that emphatically termed the
      virtue of our sex, Helen, on which social happiness rests, society
      depends, on what is it based? is it not on that single-hearted virtue
      truth?&mdash;and truth on what? on courage of the mind. They who dare to
      speak the truth, will not ever dare to go irretrievably wrong. Then what
      is falsehood but cowardice?&mdash;and a false woman!&mdash;does not that
      say all in one word?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But whence arose all this? you wonder, perhaps,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant; &ldquo;and
      I have not inclination to explain. Here comes Lord Davenant. Now for
      politics&mdash;farewell morality, a long farewell. Now for the London
      budget, and &lsquo;what news from Constantinople? Grand vizier certainly
      strangled, or not?&rsquo;&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The London budget of news was now opened, and gone through by Lord
      Davenant, including quarrels in the cabinet and all that with fear of
      change perplexes politicians. But the fears and hopes of different ages
      are attached to such different subjects, that Helen heard all this as
      though she heard it not, and went on with her drawing, touching, and
      retouching it, without ever looking up, till her attention was wakened by
      the name of Granville Beauclerc; this was the name of the person who had
      written those interesting letters which she had met with in Lady
      Davenant&rsquo;s portfolio. &ldquo;What is he doing in town?&rdquo; asked the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amusing himself, I suppose,&rdquo; replied Lord Davenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe he forgets that I am his guardian,&rdquo; said the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure he cannot forget that you are his friend,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia;
      &ldquo;for he has the best heart in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the worst head for any thing useful,&rdquo; said the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a man of genius,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you speak to him, my lord,&rdquo; pursued the general, &ldquo;about standing for
      the county?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he said what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he would have nothing to do with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something about not being tied to party, and somewhat he said about
      patriotism,&rdquo; replied Lord Davenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said the general, &ldquo;he is a fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only young,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men are not so very young in these days at two-and-twenty,&rdquo; said the
      general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In some,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant, &ldquo;the classical touch, the romance of
      political virtue, lasts for months, if not years, after they leave
      college; even those who, like Granville, go into high life in London, do
      not sometimes, for a season or two, lose their first enthusiasm of
      patriotism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general&rsquo;s lips became compressed. Lord Davenant, throwing himself back
      in his easy chair, repeated, &ldquo;Patriotism! yes, every young man of talent
      is apt to begin with a fit of that sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear lord,&rdquo; cried Lady Davenant, &ldquo;you, of all men, to speak of
      patriotism as a disease!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a disease that can be had but once in life, I am afraid,&rdquo; replied her
      lord laughing; &ldquo;and yet,&rdquo; as if believing in that at which he laughed, &ldquo;it
      evaporates in most men in words, written or spoken, lasts till the first
      pamphlet is published, or till the maiden-speech in parliament is fairly
      made, and fairly paid for&mdash;in all honour&mdash;all honourable men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Davenant passed over these satirical observations, and somewhat
      abruptly asked Lord Davenant if he recollected the late Mr. Windham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly he was not a man to be easily forgotten: but what in
      particular?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The scales of his mind were too fine,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant, &ldquo;too nicely
      adjusted for common purposes; diamond scales will not do for weighing
      wool. Very refined, very ingenious, very philosophical minds, such as
      Windham, Burke, Bacon, were all too scrupulous weighers; their scales
      turned with the millionth of a grain, and all from the same cause, subject
      to the same defect, indecision. They saw too well how much can be said on
      both sides of the question. There is a sort of philosophical doubt,
      arising from enlargement of understanding, quite different from that
      irresolution of character which is caused by infirmity of will; and I have
      observed,&rdquo; continued Lady Davenant, &ldquo;in some of these over scrupulous
      weighers, that when once they come to a balance, that instant they become
      most wilful; so it will be, you will see, with Beauclerc. After excessive
      indecision, you will see him start perhaps at once to rash action.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rash of wrong, resolute of right,&rdquo; said Lord Davenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is constitutionally wilful, and metaphysically vacillating,&rdquo; said Lady
      Davenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general waited till the metaphysics were over, and then said to Lord
      Davenant that he suspected there was something more than mere want of
      ambition in Beauclerc&rsquo;s refusal to go into parliament. Some words were
      here inaudible to Helen, and the general began to walk up and down the
      room with so strong a tread, that at every step the china shook on the
      table near which Helen sat, so that she lost most part of what followed,
      and yet it seemed interesting, about some Lord Beltravers, and a Comtesse
      de Saint &mdash;&mdash; something, or a Lady Blanche &mdash;&mdash;
      somebody.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Davenant looked anxious, the general&rsquo;s steps became more
      deliberately, more ominously firm; till lady Cecilia came up to him, and
      playfully linking her arm in his, the steps were moderated, and when a
      soothing hand came upon his shoulder, the compressed lips were relaxed&mdash;she
      spoke in a low voice&mdash;he answered aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all means! write to him yourself, my love; get him down here and he
      will be safe; he cannot refuse you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tuesday, then?&rdquo; she would name the earliest day if the general approved.
    </p>
    <p>
      He approved of every thing she said; &ldquo;Tuesday let it be.&rdquo; Following him to
      the door, Lady Cecilia added something which seemed to fill the measure of
      his contentment. &ldquo;Always good and kind,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;so let it be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then shall I write to your sister, or will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You,&rdquo; said the general, &ldquo;let the kindness come from you, as it always
      does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia, in a moment at the writing-table, ran off, as fast as pen
      could go, two notes, which she put into her mother&rsquo;s hand, who gave an
      approving nod; and, leaving them with her to seal and have franked,
      Cecilia darted out on the terrace, carrying Helen along with her, to see
      some Italian garden she was projecting.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as she went, and as she stood directing the workmen, at every close of
      her directions she spoke to Helen. She said she was very glad that she had
      settled that Beauclerc was to come to them immediately. He was a great
      favourite of hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for any of those grandissimo qualities which my mother sees in him,
      and which I am not quite clear exist; but just because he is the most
      agreeable person in nature; and really natural; though he is a man of the
      world, yet not the least affected. Quite fashionable, of course, but with
      true feeling. Oh! he is delightful, just&mdash;&rdquo; then she interrupted
      herself to give directions to the workmen about her Italian garden&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oleander in the middle of that bed; vases nearer to the balustrade&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beauclerc has a very good taste, and a beautiful place he has, Thorndale.
      He will be very rich. Few very rich young men are agreeable now, women
      spoil them so.&mdash;[&lsquo;Border that bed with something pretty.&lsquo;]&mdash;Still
      he is, and I long to know what you will think of him; I know what I think
      he will think, but, however, I will say no more; people are always sure to
      get into scrapes in this world, when they say what they think.&mdash;[&lsquo;That
      fountain looks beautiful.&lsquo;]&mdash;I forgot to tell you he is very
      handsome. The general is very fond of him, and he of the general, except
      when he considers him as his guardian, for Granville Beauclerc does not
      particularly like to be controlled&mdash;who does? It is a curious story.&mdash;[&lsquo;Unpack
      those vases, and by the time that is done I will be back.&lsquo;]&mdash;Take a
      turn with me, Helen, this way. It is a curious story: Granville
      Beauclerc&rsquo;s father&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t know it perfectly, I only know that
      he was a very odd man, and left the general, though he was so much younger
      than himself, guardian to Granville, and settled that he was not to be of
      age, I mean not to come into possession of his large estates, till he is
      five-and-twenty: shockingly hard on poor Granville, and enough to make him
      hate Clarendon, but he does not, and that is charming, that is one reason
      I like him! So amazingly respectful to his guardian always, considering
      how impetuous he is, amazingly respectful, though I cannot say I think he
      is what the gardening books call <i>patient of the knife</i>, I don&rsquo;t
      think he likes his fancies to be lopped; but then he is so clever. Much
      more what you would call a reading man than the general, distinguished at
      college, and all that which usually makes a young man conceited, but
      Beauclerc is only a little headstrong&mdash;all the more agreeable, it
      keeps one in agitation; one never knows how it will end, but I am sure it
      will all go on well now. It is curious, too, that mamma knew him also when
      he was at Eton, I believe&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know how, but long before we ever
      heard of Clarendon, and she corresponded with him, but I never knew him
      till he came to Florence, just after it was all settled with me and the
      general; and he was with us there and at Paris, and travelled home with
      us, and I like him. Now you know all, except what I do not choose to tell
      you, so come back to the workmen&mdash;&lsquo;That vase will not do there, move
      it in front of these evergreens; that will do.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then returning to Helen&mdash;&ldquo;After all, I did so right, and I am so glad
      I thought in time of inviting Esther, now Mr. Beauclerc is coming&mdash;the
      general&rsquo;s sister&mdash;half sister. Oh, so unlike him! you would never
      guess that Miss Clarendon was his sister, except from her pride. But she
      is so different from other people; she knows nothing, and wishes to know
      nothing of the world. She lives always at an old castle in Wales, Llan
      &mdash;&mdash; something, which she inherited from her mother, and she has
      always been her own mistress, living with her aunt in melancholy grandeur
      there, till her brother brought her to Florence, where&mdash;oh, how she
      was out of her element! Come this way and I will tell you more. The fact
      is, I do not not much like Miss Clarendon, and I will tell you why&mdash;I
      will describe her to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, do not,&rdquo; said Helen; &ldquo;do not, my dear Cecilia, and I will tell
      you why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why?&rdquo; cried Cecilia. &ldquo;Do you recollect the story my uncle told
      us about the young bride and her old friend, and the bit of advice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No, Cecilia did not recollect any thing of it. She should be very glad to
      hear the anecdote, but as to the advice, she hated advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, if you knew who gave it&mdash;it was given by a very great man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very great man! now you make me curious. Well, what is it?&rdquo; said Lady
      Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That for one year after her marriage, she would not tell to her friends
      the opinion she had formed, if unfavourable, of any of her husband&rsquo;s
      relations, as it was probable she might change that opinion on knowing
      them better, and would afterwards be sorry for having told her first hasty
      judgment. Long afterwards the lady told her friend that she owed to this
      advice a great part of the happiness of her life, for she really had, in
      the course of the year, completely changed her first notions of some of
      her husband&rsquo;s family, and would have had sorely to repent, if she had told
      her first thoughts!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia listened, and said it was all &ldquo;Vastly well! excellent! But I had
      nothing in the world to say of Miss Clarendon, but that she was too good&mdash;too
      sincere for the world we live in. For instance, at Paris, one day a
      charming Frenchwoman was telling some anecdote of the day in the most
      amusing manner. Esther Clarendon all the while stood by, grave and black
      as night, and at last turning upon our charmer at the end of the story,
      pronounced, &lsquo;There is not one word of truth in all you have been saying!&rsquo; 
      Conceive it, in full salon! The French were in such amazement.
      &lsquo;Inconceivable!&rsquo; as they might well say to me, as she walked off with her
      tragedy-queen air; <i>&lsquo;Inconcevable&mdash;mais, vraiment inconcevable;&rsquo;&rsquo;</i>
      and <i>&lsquo;Bien Anglaise,&rsquo;&rsquo;</i> they would have added, no doubt, if I had not
      been by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there must surely have been some particular reason,&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None in the world, only the story was not true, I believe. And then
      another time, when she was with her cousin, the Duchess of Lisle, at
      Lisle-Royal, and was to have gone out the next season in London with the
      Duchess, she came down one morning, just before they were to set off for
      town, and declared that she had heard such a quantity of scandal since she
      had been there, and such shocking things of London society, that she had
      resolved not to go out with the Duchess, and not to go to town at all? So
      absurd&mdash;so prudish!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen felt some sympathy in this, and was going to have said so, but
      Cecilia went on with&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then to expect that Granville Beauclerc&mdash;should&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Cecilia paused, and Helen felt curious, and ashamed of her curiosity;
      she turned away, to raise the branches of some shrub, which were drooping
      from the weight of their flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know something <i>has</i> been thought of,&rdquo; said Cecilia. &ldquo;A match has
      been in contemplation&mdash;do you comprehend me, Helen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that Mr. Beauclerc is to marry Miss Clarendon,&rdquo; said Helen,
      compelled to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only say it has been thought of,&rdquo; replied Lady Cecilia; &ldquo;that is, as
      every thing in this way is thought of about every couple not within the
      prohibited degrees, one&rsquo;s grandmother inclusive. And the plainer the
      woman, the more sure she is to contemplate such things for herself, lest
      no one else should think of them for her. But, my dear Helen, if you mean
      to ask&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean to ask any thing,&rdquo; cried Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, whether you ask or not, I must tell you that the general is too
      proud to own, even to himself, that he could; ever think of any man for
      his sister who had not first proposed for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause for some minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; resumed Lady Cecilia, &ldquo;I could not do less than ask her here for
      Clarendon&rsquo;s sake, when I know it pleases him; and she is very&mdash;estimable,
      and so I wish to make her love me if I could! But I do not think she will
      be nearer her point with Mr. Beauclerc, if it is her point, by coming here
      just now. Granville has eyes as well as ears, and contrasts will strike. I
      know who I wish should strike him, as she strikes me&mdash;and I think&mdash;I
      hope&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen looked distressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am as innocent as a dove,&rdquo; pursued Lady Cecilia; &ldquo;but I suppose even
      doves may have their own private little thoughts and wishes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen was sure Cecilia had meant all this most kindly, but she was sorry
      that some things had been said. She was conscious of having been
      interested by those letters of Mr. Beauclerc&rsquo;s; but a particular thought
      had now been put into her mind, and she could never more say, never more
      feel, that such a thought had not come into her head. She was very sorry;
      it seemed as if somewhat of the freshness, the innocence, of her mind was
      gone from her. She was sorry, too, that she had heard all that Cecilia had
      said about Miss Clarendon; it appeared as if she was actually doomed to
      get into some difficulty with the general about his sister; she felt as if
      thrown back into a sea of doubts, and she was not clear that she could,
      even by opposing, end them.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the appointed Tuesday, late, Miss Clarendon arrived; a fine figure, but
      ungraceful, as Helen observed, from the first moment when she turned
      sharply away from Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s embrace to a great dog of her brother&rsquo;s&mdash;&ldquo;Ah,
      old Neptune! I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re here still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And when Lady Cecilia would have put down his paws&mdash;&ldquo;Let him alone,
      let him alone, dear, honest, old fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the dear, honest, old fellow&rsquo;s paws are wet, and will ruin your
      pretty new pelisse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be new, but you know it is not pretty,&rdquo; said Miss Clarendon,
      continuing to pat Neptune&rsquo;s head as he jumped up with his paws on her
      shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O my dear Esther, how can you bear him? he is so rough in his love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like rough better than smooth.&rdquo; The rough paw caught in her lace frill,
      and it was torn to pieces before &ldquo;down! down!&rdquo; and the united efforts of
      Lady Cecilia and Helen could extricate it.&mdash;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t distress
      yourselves about it, pray; it does not signify in the least. Poor Neptune,
      how really sorry he looks&mdash;there, there, wag your tail again&mdash;no
      one shall come between us two old friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her brother came in, and, starting up, her arms were thrown round his
      neck, and her bonnet falling back, Helen who had thought her quite plain
      before, was surprised to see that, now her colour was raised, and there
      was life in her eyes, she was really handsome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gone again that expression, when Cecilia spoke to her: whatever she said,
      Miss Clarendon differed from; if it was a matter of taste, she was always
      of the contrary opinion; if narrative or assertion, she questioned,
      doubted, seemed as if she could not believe. Her conversation, if
      conversation it could be called, was a perpetual rebating and regrating,
      especially with her sister-in-law; if Lady Cecilia did but say there were
      three instead of four, it was taken up as &ldquo;quite a mistake,&rdquo; and marked
      not only as a mistake, but as &ldquo;not true.&rdquo; Every, the slightest error,
      became a crime against majesty, and the first day ended with Helen&rsquo;s
      thinking her really the most disagreeable, intolerable person she had ever
      seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the second day went on a little worse. Helen thought Cecilia took too
      much pains to please, and said it would be better to let her quite alone.
      Helen did so completely, but Miss Clarendon did not let Helen alone; but
      watched her with penetrating eyes continually, listened to every word she
      said, and seeming to weigh every syllable,&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, my words are not
      worth your weighing,&rdquo; said Helen, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes they are, to settle my mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The first thing that seemed at all to settle it was Helen&rsquo;s not agreeing
      with Cecilia about the colour of two ribands which Helen said she could
      not flatter her were good matches. The next was about a drawing of Miss
      Clarendon&rsquo;s, of Llansillan, her place in Wales; a beautiful drawing
      indeed, which she had brought for her brother, but one of the towers
      certainly was out of the perpendicular. Helen was appealed to, and could
      not say it was upright; Miss Clarendon instantly took up a knife, cut the
      paper at the back of the frame, and, taking out the drawing, set the tower
      to rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the use of telling the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of listening to it,&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall get on, I see, Miss Stanley, if you can get over the first
      bitter outside of me;&mdash;a hard outside, difficult to crack&mdash;stains
      delicate fingers, may be,&rdquo; she continued, as she replaced her drawing in
      its frame&mdash;&ldquo;stains delicate fingers, may be, in the opening, but a
      good walnut you will find it, taken with a grain of salt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Many a grain seemed necessary, and very strong nut-crackers in very strong
      hands. Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s evidently were not strong enough, though she
      strained hard. Helen did not feel inclined to try.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia invited Miss Clarendon to walk out and see some of the alterations
      her brother had made. As they passed the new Italian garden, Miss
      Clarendon asked, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this?&mdash;don&rsquo;t like this&mdash;how I
      regret the Old English garden, and the high beech hedges. Every thing is
      to be changed here, I suppose,&mdash;pray do not ask my opinion about any
      of the alterations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not wonder,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;that you should prefer the old garden,
      with all your early associations; warm-hearted, amiable people must always
      be so fond of what they have loved in childhood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never was here when I was a child, and I am not one of your amiable
      people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true, indeed,&rdquo; thought Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Stanley looks at me as if I had seven heads,&rdquo; said Miss Clarendon,
      laughing; and, a minute after, overtaking Helen as she walked on, she
      looked full in her face, and added, &ldquo;Do acknowledge that you think me a
      savage.&rdquo; Helen did not deny it, and from that moment Miss Clarendon looked
      less savagely upon her: she laughed and said, &ldquo;I am not quite such a bear
      as I seem, you&rsquo;ll find; at least I never hug people to death. My growl is
      worse than my bite, unless some one should flatter my classical, bearish
      passion, and offer to feed me with honey, and when I find it all comb and
      no honey, who would not growl then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia now came up, and pointed out views to which the general had
      opened. &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s well, he has done very well, but pray don&rsquo;t stand on
      ceremony with me. I can walk alone, you may leave me to my own
      cogitations, as I like best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, as you like best,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia; &ldquo;pray consider yourself, as
      you know you are, at home here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I never shall be at home here,&rdquo; said Esther.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t say that, let me hope&mdash;let me hope&mdash;&rdquo; and she
      withdrew. Helen just stayed to unlock a gate for Miss Clarendon&rsquo;s &lsquo;rambles
      further,&rsquo; and, as she unlocked it, she heard Miss Clarendon sigh as she
      repeated the word, &ldquo;Hope! I do not like to hope, hope has so often
      deceived me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will never be deceived in Cecilia,&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care&mdash;stay till you try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have tried,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;I know her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From childhood!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re scarcely out of childhood yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not so very young. I have had trials of my friends&mdash;of Cecilia
      particularly, much more than you could ever have had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this is the best thing I ever heard of her, and from good authority
      too; her friends abroad were all false,&rdquo; said Miss Clarendon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very extraordinary,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;to hear such a young person as
      you are talk so&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So&mdash;how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of false friends&mdash;you must have been very unfortunate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me&mdash;very fortunate&mdash;to find them out in time.&rdquo; She
      looked at the prospect, and liked all that her brother was doing, and
      disliked all that she even guessed Lady Cecilia had done. Helen showed her
      that she guessed wrong here and there, and smiled at her prejudices; and
      Miss Clarendon smiled again, and admitted that she was prejudiced, &ldquo;but
      every body is; only some show and tell, and others smile and fib. I wish
      that word fib was banished from English language, and white lie drummed
      out after it. Things by their right names and we should all do much
      better. Truth must be told, whether agreeable or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But whoever makes truth disagreeable commits high treason against
      virtue,&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that yours?&rdquo; cried Miss Clarendon, stopping short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;It is excellent whoever said it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was from my uncle Stanley I heard it,&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Superior man that uncle must have been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will leave you now,&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do, I see we shall like one another in time, Miss Stanley; in time,&mdash;I
      hate sudden friendships.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That evening Miss Clarendon questioned Helen more about her friendship
      with Cecilia, and how it was she came to live with her. Helen plainly told
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it was not an original promise between you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Cecilia told me it was. Just like her,&mdash;I knew all the time it
      was a lie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shocked and startled at the word, and at the idea, Helen exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh!
      Miss Clarendon, how can you say so? anybody may be mistaken. Cecilia
      mistook&mdash;&rdquo; Lady Cecilia joined them at this moment. Miss Clarendon&rsquo;s
      face was flushed. &ldquo;This room is insufferably hot. What can be the use of a
      fire at this time of year?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia said it was for her mother, who was apt to be chilly in the
      evenings; and as she spoke, she put a screen between the flushed cheek and
      the fire. Miss Clarendon pushed it away, saying, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t talk, I can&rsquo;t
      hear, I can&rsquo;t understand with a screen before me. What did you say, Lady
      Cecilia, to Lady Davenant, as we came out from dinner, about Mr.
      Beauclerc?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That we expect him to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did not tell me so when you wrote!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why pray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know, Lady Cecilia! why should people say they do not know,
      when they do know perfectly well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had thought it was of any consequence to you, Esther,&rdquo; said Cecilia,
      with an arch look&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you expect me to answer that it was not of the least consequence to
      me&mdash;that is the answer you would make; but my answer is, that it was
      of consequence to me, and you knew it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if I did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you did, why say &lsquo;If I had thought it of any consequence to you?&rsquo;&mdash;why
      say so? answer me truly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer me truly!&rdquo; repeated Lady Cecilia, laughing. &ldquo;Oh, my dear Esther,
      we are not in a court of justice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor in a court of honour,&rdquo; pursued Miss Clarendon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well! let it be a court of love at least,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia. &ldquo;What
      a pretty proverb that was, Helen, that we met with the other day in that
      book of old English proverbs&mdash;&lsquo;Love rules his kingdom without a
      sword.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely; but to the point,&rdquo; said Miss Clarendon, &ldquo;when do you expect
      Mr. Beauclerc?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I shall go to-morrow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Esther, why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know why; you know what reports have been spread; it suits neither my
      character nor my brother&rsquo;s to give any foundation for such reports. Let me
      ring the bell and I will give my own orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Esther, but your brother will be so vexed&mdash;so surprised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother is the best judge of his own conduct, he will do what he
      pleases, or what you please. I am the judge of mine, and certainly shall
      do what I think right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rang accordingly, and ordered that her carriage should be at the door
      at six o&rsquo;clock in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, my dear Esther,&rdquo; persisted Cecilia, &ldquo;I wish you would not decide so
      suddenly; we were so glad to have you come to us&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad! why you know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; interrupted Lady Cecilia, colouring, and she began as fast as
      possible to urge every argument she could think of to persuade Miss
      Clarendon; but no arguments, no entreaties of hers or the general&rsquo;s,
      public or private, were of any avail,&mdash;go she would, and go she did
      at six o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Helen to Lady Davenant, &ldquo;that Miss Clarendon is very
      estimable, and she seems to be very clever: but I wonder that with all her
      abilities she does not learn to make her manners more agreeable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant, &ldquo;we must take people as they are; you may
      graft a rose upon an oak, but those who have tried the experiment tell us
      the graft will last but a short time, and the operation ends in the
      destruction of both; where the stocks have no common nature, there is ever
      a want of conformity which sooner or later proves fatal to both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Beauclerc, what was become of him?&mdash;that day passed, and no
      Beauclerc; another and another came, and on the third day, only a letter
      from him, which ought to have come on Tuesday.&mdash;But &ldquo;<i>too late</i>,&rdquo;
       the shameful brand of procrastination was upon it&mdash;and it contained
      only a few lines blotted in the folding, to say that he could not possibly
      be at Clarendon Park on Tuesday, but would on Wednesday or Thursday if
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good-natured Lord Davenant observed, &ldquo;When a young man in London, writing
      to his friends in the country, names two days for leaving town, and adds
      an &lsquo;<i>if possible</i>&rsquo; his friends should never expect him till the last
      of the two named.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last of the two days arrived&mdash;Thursday. The aide-de-camp asked if
      Mr. Beauclerc was expected to-day. &ldquo;Yes, I expect to see him to-day,&rdquo; the
      general answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope, but do not expect,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant, &ldquo;for, as learned
      authority tells me, &lsquo;to expect is to hope with some degree of certainty&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general left the room repeating, &ldquo;I expect him to-day, Cecilia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The day passed, however, and he came not&mdash;the night came. The general
      ordered that the gate should be kept open, and that a servant should sit
      up. The servant sat up all night, cursing Mr. Beauclerc. And in the
      morning he replied with malicious alacrity to the first question his
      master asked, &ldquo;No, Sir, Mr. Beauclerc is not come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At breakfast, the general, after buttering his bread in silence for some
      minutes, confessed that he loved punctuality. It might be a military
      prejudice;&mdash;it might be too professional, martinet perhaps,&mdash;but
      still he owned he did love punctuality. He considered it as a part of
      politeness, a proper attention to the convenience and feelings of others;
      indispensable between strangers it is usually felt to be, and he did not
      know why intimate friends should deem themselves privileged to dispense
      with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes met Helen&rsquo;s as he finished these words, and smiling, he
      complimented her upon her constant punctuality. It was a voluntary grace
      in a lady, but an imperative duty in a man&mdash;and a young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are fond of this young man, I see general,&rdquo; said Lord Davenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not of his fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia said something about forgiving a first fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; said Lady Davenant. &ldquo;Lord Collingwood&rsquo;s rule was&mdash;never
      forgive a first fault, and you will not have a second. You love Beauclerc,
      I see, as Lord Davenant says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love him!&rdquo; resumed the general; &ldquo;with all his faults and follies, I love
      him as if he were my brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At which words Lady Cecilia, with a scarcely perceptible smile, cast a
      furtive glance at Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general called for his horses, and, followed by his aide-de-camp,
      departed, saying that he should be back at luncheon-time, when he hoped to
      find Beauclerc. In the same hope, Lady Davenant ordered her pony-phaeton
      earlier than usual; Lady Cecilia further hoped most earnestly that
      Beauclerc would come this day, for the next the house would be full of
      company, and she really wished to have him one day at least to themselves,
      and she gave a most significant glance at Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first move often secures the game against the best players,&rdquo; said
      she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen blushed, because she could not help understanding; she was ashamed,
      vexed with Cecilia, yet pleased by her kindness, and half amused by her
      arch look and tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were neither of them aware that Lady Davenant had heard the words
      that passed, or seen the looks; but immediately afterwards, when they were
      leaving the breakfast-room, Lady Davenant came between the two friends,
      laid her hand upon her daughter&rsquo;s arm, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before you make any move in a dangerous game, listen to the voice of old
      experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia startled, looked up, but as if she did not comprehend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cupid&rsquo;s bow, my dear,&rdquo; continued her mother, &ldquo;is, as the Asiatics tell
      us, strung with bees, which are apt to sting&mdash;sometimes fatally&mdash;those
      who meddle with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia still looked with an innocent air, and still as if she could
      not comprehend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To speak more plainly, then, Cecilia,&rdquo; said her mother, &ldquo;build no
      matrimonial castles in the air; standing or falling they do mischief&mdash;mischief
      either to the builder, or to those for whom they may be built.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly if they fall they disappoint one,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia, &ldquo;but if
      they stand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that she made no impression on her daughter, Lady Davenant turned
      to Helen, and gravely said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Helen, do not let my daughter inspire you with false, and perhaps
      vain imaginations, certainly premature, therefore unbecoming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen shrunk back, yet instantly looked up, and her look was ingenuously
      grateful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, mamma,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia, &ldquo;I declare I do not understand what all
      this is about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About Mr. Granville Beauclerc,&rdquo; said her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you, dear mamma, pronounce his name so <i>tout an long?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon my indelicacy, my dear; delicacy is a good thing, but truth a
      better. I have seen the happiness of many young women sacrificed by such
      false delicacy, and by the fear of giving a moment&rsquo;s present pain, which
      it is sometimes the duty of a true friend to give.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, certainly, mamma, only not necessary now; and I am so sorry
      you have said all this to poor dear Helen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you have said nothing to her, Cecilia, I acknowledge I have said too
      much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said&mdash;I did nothing,&rdquo; cried Lady Cecilia; &ldquo;I built no castles&mdash;never
      built a regular castle in my life; never had a regular plan in my
      existence; never mentioned his name, except about another person&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An appealing look to Helen was however <i>protested</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the best of my recollection, at least,&rdquo; Lady Cecilia immediately
      added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen seems to be blushing for your want of recollection, Cecilia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure I do not know why you blush, Helen. I am certain I never did
      say a word distinctly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not <i>distinctly</i> certainly,&rdquo; said Helen in a low voice. &ldquo;It was my
      fault if I understood&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always true, you are,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I protest I said nothing but the truth,&rdquo; cried Lady Cecilia hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not the whole truth, Cecilia,&rdquo; said her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did, upon my word, mamma,&rdquo; persisted Lady Cecilia, repeating &ldquo;upon my
      word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon your word, Cecilia! that is either a vulgar expletive or a most
      serious asseveration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke with a grave tone, and with her severe look, and Helen dared not
      raise her eyes; Lady Cecilia now coloured deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shame! Nature&rsquo;s hasty conscience,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant. &ldquo;Heaven preserve
      it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mother!&rdquo; cried Lady Cecilia, laying her hand on her mother&rsquo;s, &ldquo;surely
      you do not think seriously&mdash;surely you are not angry&mdash;I cannot
      bear to see you displeased,&rdquo; said she, looking up imploringly in her
      mother&rsquo;s face, and softly, urgently pressing her hand. No pressure was
      returned; that hand was slowly and with austere composure withdrawn, and
      her mother walked away down the corridor to her own room. Lady Cecilia
      stood still, and the tears came into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friend, I am exceedingly sorry,&rdquo; said Helen. She could not
      believe that Cecilia meant to say what was not true, yet she felt that she
      had been to blame in not telling all, and her mother in saying too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia, her tears dispersed, stood looking at the impression which
      her mother&rsquo;s signet-ring had left in the palm of her hand. It was at that
      moment a disagreeable recollection that the motto of that ring was
      &ldquo;Truth.&rdquo; Rubbing the impress from her hand, she said, half speaking to
      herself, and half to Helen&mdash;&ldquo;I am sure I did not mean anything wrong;
      and I am sure nothing can be more true than that I never formed a regular
      plan in my life. After all, I am sure that so much has been said about
      nothing, that I do not understand anything: I never do, when mamma goes on
      in that way, making mountains of molehills, which she always does with me,
      and did ever since I was a child; but she really forgets that I am not a
      child. Now, it is well the general was not by; he would never have borne
      to see his wife so treated. But I would not, for the world, be the cause
      of any disagreement. Oh! Helen, my mother does not know how I love her,
      let her be ever so severe to me! But she never loved me; she cannot help
      it. I believe she does her best to love me&mdash;my poor, dear mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen seized this opportunity to repeat the warm expressions she had heard
      so lately from Lady Davenant, and melting they sunk into Cecilia&rsquo;s heart.
      She kissed Helen again and again, for a dear, good peacemaker, as she
      always was&mdash;and &ldquo;I&rsquo;m resolved&rdquo;&mdash;but in the midst of her good
      resolves she caught a glimpse through the glass door opening on the park,
      of the general, and a fine horse they were ringing, and she hurried out:
      all light of heart she went, as though
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Since Lord Davenant&rsquo;s arrival, Lady Davenant&rsquo;s time was so much taken up
      with him, that Helen could not have many opportunities of conversing with
      her, and she was the more anxious to seize every one that occurred. She
      always watched for the time when Lady Davenant went out in her pony
      phaeton, for then she had her delightfully to herself, the carriage
      holding only two.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at the door, and Lady Davenant was crossing the hall followed by
      Helen, when Cecilia came in with a look, unusual in her, of being much
      discomfited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another put off from Mr. Beauclerc! He will not be here to-day. I give
      him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Davenant stopped short, and asked whether Cecilia had told him that
      probably she should soon be gone?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure I did, mamma.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what reason does he give for his delay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None, mamma, none&mdash;not the least apology. He says, very cavalierly
      indeed, that he is the worst man in the world at making excuses&mdash;shall
      attempt none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There he is right&rdquo; said Lady Davenant. &ldquo;Those who are good at excuses, as
      Franklin justly observed, are apt to be good for nothing else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general came up the steps at this moment, rolling a note between his
      fingers, and looking displeased. Lady Davenant inquired if he could tell
      her the cause of Mr. Beauclerc&rsquo;s delay. He could not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;Very extraordinary! Provoking! Insufferable!
      Intolerable!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Mr. Beauclerc&rsquo;s own affair,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant, wrapping her shawl
      round her; and, taking the general&rsquo;s arm, she walked on to her carriage.
      Seating herself, and gathering up the reins, she repeated&mdash;&ldquo;Mr.
      Beauclerc&rsquo;s own affair, completely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lash of her whip was caught somewhere, and, while the groom was
      disentangling it, she reiterated&mdash;&ldquo;That will do: let the horses go:&rdquo;&mdash;and
      with half-suppressed impatience thanked Helen, who was endeavouring to
      arrange some ill-disposed cloak&mdash;&ldquo;Thank you, thank you, my dear: it&rsquo;s
      all very well. Sit down, Helen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drove off rapidly, through the beautiful park scenery But the ancient
      oaks, standing alone, casting vast shadows, the distant massive woods of
      magnificent extent and of soft and varied foliage; the secluded glades,
      all were lost upon her. Looking straight between her horses&rsquo; ears, she
      drove on in absolute silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen&rsquo;s idea of Mr. Beauclerc&rsquo;s importance increased wonderfully. What
      must he be whose coming or not coming could so move all the world, or
      those who were all the world to her? And, left to her own cogitations, she
      was picturing to herself what manner of man he might be, when suddenly
      Lady Davenant turned, and asked what she was thinking of?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon for startling you so, my dear; I am aware that it is a
      dreadfully imprudent, impertinent question&mdash;one which, indeed, I
      seldom ask. Few interest me sufficiently to make me care of what they
      think: from fewer still could I expect to hear the truth. Nay&mdash;nothing
      upon compulsion, Helen. Only say plainly, if you would rather not tell me.
      That answer I should prefer to the ingenious formula of evasion, the
      solecism in metaphysics, which Cecilia used the other day, when
      unwittingly I asked her of what she was thinking&mdash;&lsquo;Of a great many
      different things, mamma.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen, still more alarmed by Lady Davenant&rsquo;s speech than by her question,
      and aware of the conclusions which might be drawn from her answer,
      nevertheless bravely replied that she had been thinking of Mr. Beauclerc,
      of what he might be whose coming or not coming was of such consequence. As
      she spoke the expression of Lady Davenant&rsquo;s countenance changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, my dear child, you are truth itself, and truly do I love you
      therefore. It&rsquo;s well that you did not ask me of what I was thinking, for I
      am not sure that I could have answered so directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I could never have presumed to ask such a question of you,&rdquo; said
      Helen, &ldquo;there is such a difference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Lady Davenant; &ldquo;there is such a difference as age and
      authority require to be made, but nevertheless, such as is not quite
      consistent with the equal rights of friendship. You have told me the
      subject of your day-dream, my love, and if you please, I will tell you the
      subject of mine. I was rapt into times long past: I was living over again
      some early scenes&mdash;some which are connected, and which connect me, in
      a curious manner, with this young man, Mr. Granville Beauclerc.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seemed to speak with some difficulty, and yet to be resolved to go on.
      &ldquo;Helen, I have a mind,&rdquo; continued she, &ldquo;to tell you what, in the language
      of affected autobiographers, I might call &lsquo;some passages of my life.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen&rsquo;s eyes brightened, as she eagerly thanked her: but hearing a
      half-suppressed sigh, she added&mdash;&ldquo;Not if it is painful to you though,
      my dear Lady Davenant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Painful it must be,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;but it may be useful to you; and a
      weak friend is that who can do only what is pleasurable. You have often
      trusted me with those little inmost feelings of the heart, which, however
      innocent, we shrink from exposing to any but the friends we most love; it
      is unjust and absurd of those advancing in years to expect of the young
      that confidence should come all and only on their side: the human heart,
      at whatever age, opens only to the heart that opens in return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Davenant paused again, and then said,&mdash;&ldquo;It is a general opinion,
      that nobody is the better for advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure I do not think so,&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you do not; nor do I. Much depends upon the way in which it is
      offered. General maxims, drawn from experience, are, to the young at
      least, but as remarks&mdash;moral sentences&mdash;mere dead letter, and
      take no hold of the mind. &lsquo;I have felt&rsquo; must come before &lsquo;I think,&rsquo; 
      especially in speaking to a young friend, and, though I am accused of
      being so fond of generalising that I never come to particulars, I can and
      will: therefore, my dear, I will tell you some particulars of my life, in
      which, take notice, there are no adventures. Mine has been a life of
      passion&mdash;of feeling, at least,&mdash;not of incidents: nothing, my
      dear, to excite or to gratify curiosity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, independent of all curiosity about events,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;there is
      such an interest in knowing what has been really felt and thought in their
      former lives by those we know and love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall sink in your esteem,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant&mdash;&ldquo;so be it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I need not begin, as most people do, with &lsquo;I was born&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo; but,
      interrupting herself, she said, &ldquo;this heat is too much for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They turned into a long shady drive through the woods. Lady Davenant drew
      up the reins, and her ponies walked slowly on the grassy road; then,
      turning to Helen, she said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would have been well for me if any friend had, when I was of your age,
      put me on my guard against my own heart: but my too indulgent, too
      sanguine mother, led me into the very danger against which she should have
      warned me&mdash;she misled me, though without being aware of it. Our
      minds, our very natures differed strangely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was a castle-builder&mdash;yes, now you know, my dear, why I spoke so
      strongly, and, as you thought, so severely this morning. My mother was a
      castle-builder of the ordinary sort: a worldly plan of a castle was hers,
      and little care had she about the knight within; yet she had sufficient
      tact to know that it must be the idea of the <i>preux chevalier</i> that
      would lure her daughter into the castle. Prudent for herself, imprudent
      for me, and yet she loved me&mdash;all she did was for love of me. She
      managed with so much address, that I had no suspicion of my being the
      subject of any speculation&mdash;otherwise, probably, my imagination might
      have revolted, my self-will have struggled, my pride have interfered, or
      my delicacy might have been alarmed, but nothing of all that happened; I
      was only too ready, too glad to believe all that I was told, all that
      appeared in that spring-time of hope and love. I was very romantic, not in
      the modern fashionable young-lady sense of the word, with the mixed ideas
      of a shepherdess&rsquo;s hat and the paraphernalia of a peeress&mdash;love in a
      cottage, and a fashionable house in town. No; mine was honest, pure, real
      romantic love&mdash;absurd if you will; it was love nursed by imagination
      more than by hope. I had early, in my secret soul, as perhaps you have at
      this instant in yours, a pattern of perfection&mdash;something chivalrous,
      noble, something that is no longer to be seen now-a-days&mdash;the more
      delightful to imagine, the moral sublime and beautiful; more than human,
      yet with the extreme of human tenderness. Mine was to be a demigod whom I
      could worship, a husband to whom I could always look up, with whom I could
      always sympathise, and to whom I could devote myself with all a woman&rsquo;s
      self-devotion. I had then a vast idea&mdash;as I think you have now, Helen&mdash;of
      self-devotion; you would devote yourself to your friends, but I could not
      shape any of my friends into a fit object. So after my own imagination I
      made one, dwelt upon it, doated on it, and at last threw this bright image
      of my own fancy full upon the being to whom I thought I was most happily
      destined&mdash;destined by duty, chosen by affection. The words &lsquo;I love
      you&rsquo; once pronounced, I gave my whole heart in return, gave it,
      sanctified, as I felt, by religion. I had high religious sentiments; a vow
      once passed the lips, a look, a single look of appeal to Heaven, was as
      much for me as if pronounced at the altar, and before thousands to
      witness. Some time was to elapse before the celebration of our marriage.
      Protracted engagements are unwise, yet I should not say so; this gave me
      time to open my eyes&mdash;my bewitched eyes: still, some months I passed
      in a trance of beatification, with visions of duties all performed&mdash;benevolence
      universal, and gratitude, and high success, and crowns of laurel, for my
      hero, for he was military; it all joined well in my fancy. All the
      pictured tales of vast heroic deeds were to be his. Living, I was to live
      in the radiance of his honour; or dying, to die with him, and then to be
      most blessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all to me now as a dream, long passed, and never told; no, never,
      except to him who had a right to know it&mdash;my husband, and now to you,
      Helen. From my dream I was awakened by a rude shock&mdash;I saw, I thank
      Heaven I first, and I alone, saw that his heart was gone from me&mdash;that
      his heart had never been mine&mdash;that it was unworthy of me. No, I will
      not say that; I will not think so. Still I trust he had deceived himself,
      though not so much as he deceived me. I am willing to believe he did not
      know that what he professed for me was not love, till he was seized by
      that passion for another, a younger, fairer&mdash;&mdash;Oh! how much
      fairer. Beauty is a great gift of Heaven&mdash;not for the purposes of
      female vanity; but a great gift for one who loves, and wishes to be loved.
      But beauty I had not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had not!&rdquo; interrupted Helen, &ldquo;I always heard&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>He</i> did not think so, my dear; no matter what others thought, at
      least so I felt at that time. My identity is so much changed that I can
      look back upon this now, and tell it all to you calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was at a rehearsal of ancient music; I went there accidentally one
      morning without my mother, with a certain old duchess and her daughters;
      the dowager full of some Indian screen which she was going to buy; the
      daughters, intent, one of them, on a quarrel between two of the singers;
      the other upon loves and hates of her own. I was the only one of the party
      who had any real taste for music. I was then particularly fond of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear, I must come to the point,&rdquo; her voice changing as she
      spoke.&mdash;&ldquo;After such a lapse of time, during which my mind, my whole
      self has so changed, I could not have believed before I began to speak on
      this subject, that these reminiscences could have so moved me; but it is
      merely this sudden wakening of ideas long dormant, for years not called
      up, never put into words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was sitting, wrapt in a silent ecstasy of pleasure, leaning back behind
      the whispering party, when I saw him come in, and, thinking only of his
      sharing my delight, I made an effort to catch his attention, but he did
      not see me&mdash;his eye was fixed on another; I followed that eye, and
      saw that most beautiful creature on which it fixed; I saw him seat himself
      beside her&mdash;one look was enough&mdash;it was conviction. A pang went
      through me; I grew cold, but made no sound nor motion; I gasped for
      breath, I believe, but I did not faint. None cared for me; I was unnoticed&mdash;saved
      from the abasement of pity. I struggled to retain my self-command, and was
      enabled to complete the purpose on which I then&mdash;even <i>then</i>,
      resolved. That resolve gave me force.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In any great emotion we can speak better to those who do not care for us
      than to those who feel for us. More calmly than I now speak to you, I
      turned to the person who then sat beside me, to the dowager whose heart
      was in the Indian screen, and begged that I might not longer detain her,
      as I wished that she would carry me home&mdash;she readily complied: I had
      presence of mind enough to move when we could do so without attracting
      attention. It was well that woman talked as she did all the way home; she
      never saw, never suspected, the agony of her to whom she spoke. I ran up
      to my own room, bolted the door, and threw myself into a chair; that is
      the last thing I remember, till I found myself lying on the floor,
      wakening from a state of insensibility. I know not what time had elapsed;
      so as soon as I could I rang for my maid; she had knocked at my door, and,
      supposing I slept, had not disturbed me&mdash;my mother, I found, had not
      yet returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dressed for dinner: HE was to dine with us. It was my custom to see him
      for a few minutes before the rest of the company arrived. No time ever
      appeared to me so dreadfully long as the interval between my being dressed
      that day and his arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard him coming up stairs: my heart beat so violently that I feared I
      should not be able to speak with dignity and composure, but the motive was
      sufficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I said I know not; I am certain only that it was without one word of
      reproach. What I had at one glance foreboded was true&mdash;he
      acknowledged it. I released him from all engagement to me. I saw he was
      evidently relieved by the determined tone of my refusal&mdash;at what
      expense to my heart he was set free, he saw not&mdash;never knew&mdash;never
      suspected. But after that first involuntary expression of the pleasure of
      relief, I saw in his countenance surprise, a sort of mortified
      astonishment at my self-possession. I own my woman&rsquo;s pride enjoyed this;
      it was something better than pride&mdash;the sense of the preservation of
      my dignity. I felt that in this shipwreck of my happiness I made no
      cowardly exposure of my feelings, but he did not understand me. Our minds,
      as I now found, moved in different orbits. We could not comprehend each
      other. Instead of feeling, as the instinct of generosity would have taught
      him to feel, that I was sacrificing my happiness to his, he told me that
      he now believed I had never loved him. My eyes were opened&mdash;I saw him
      at once as he really was. The ungenerous look upon self-devotion as
      madness, folly, or art: he could not think me a fool, he did not think me
      mad, artful I believe he did suspect me to be; he concluded that I made
      the discovery of his inconstancy an excuse for my own; he thought me,
      perhaps, worse than capricious, interested&mdash;for, our engagement being
      unknown, a lover of higher rank had, in the interval, presented himself.
      My perception of this base suspicion was useful to me at the moment, as it
      roused my spirit, and I went through the better, and without relapse of
      tenderness, with that which I had undertaken. One condition only I made; I
      insisted that this explanation should rest between us two; that, in fact,
      and in manner, the breaking off the match should be left entirely to me.
      And to this part of the business I now look back with satisfaction, and I
      have honest pride in telling you, who will feel the same for me, that I
      practised in the whole conduct of the affair no deceit of any kind, not
      one falsehood was told. The world knew nothing; there my mother had been
      prudent. She was the only person to whom I was bound to explain&mdash;to
      speak, I mean, for I did not feel myself bound to explain. Perfect
      confidence only can command perfect confidence in whatever relation of
      life. I told her all that she had a right to know. I announced to her that
      the intended marriage could never be&mdash;that I objected to it; that
      both our minds were changed; that we were both satisfied in having
      released each other from our mutual engagement. I had, as I foresaw, to
      endure my mother&rsquo;s anger, her entreaties, her endless surprise, her bitter
      disappointment; but she exhausted all these, and her mind turned sooner
      than I had expected to that hope of higher establishment which amused her
      during the rest of the season in London. Two months of it were still to be
      passed&mdash;to me the two most painful months of my existence. The daily,
      nightly, effort of appearing in public, while I was thus wretched, in the
      full gala of life in the midst of the young, the gay, the happy&mdash;broken-hearted
      as I felt&mdash;it was an effort beyond my strength. That summer was, I
      remember, intolerably hot. Whenever my mother observed that I looked pale,
      and that my spirits were not so good as formerly, I exerted myself more
      and more; accepted every invitation because I dared not refuse; I danced
      at this ball, and the next, and the next; urged on, I finished to the
      dregs the dissipation of the season.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother certainly made me do dreadfully too much. But I blame others,
      as we usually do when we are ourselves the most to blame&mdash;I had
      attempted that which could not be done. By suppressing all outward sign of
      suffering, allowing no vent for sorrow in words or tears&mdash;by actual
      force of compression&mdash;I thought at once to extinguish my feelings.
      Little did I know of the human heart when I thought this! The weak are
      wise in yielding to the first shock. They cannot be struck to the earth
      who sink prostrate; sorrow has little power where there is no resistance.&mdash;&lsquo;The
      flesh will follow where the pincers tear.&rsquo; Mine was a presumptuous&mdash;it
      had nearly been a fatal struggle. That London season at last over, we got
      into the country; I expected rest, but found none. The pressing necessity
      for exertion over, the stimulus ceasing, I sunk&mdash;sunk into a state of
      apathy. Time enough had elapsed between the breaking off of my marriage
      and the appearance of this illness, to prevent any ideas on my mother&rsquo;s
      part of cause and effect, ideas indeed which were never much looked for,
      or well joined in her mind. The world knew nothing of the matter. My
      illness went under the convenient head &lsquo;nervous.&rsquo; I heard all the opinions
      pronounced on my case, and knew they were all mistaken, but I swallowed
      whatever they pleased. No physician, I repeated to myself, can &lsquo;minister
      to a mind diseased.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tried to call religion to my aid; but my religious sentiments were, at
      that time, tinctured with the enthusiasm of my early character. Had I been
      a Catholic, I should have escaped from my friends and thrown myself into a
      cloister; as it was, I had formed a strong wish to retire from that world
      which was no longer anything to me: the spring of passion, which I then
      thought the spring of life, being broken, I meditated my resolution
      secretly and perpetually as I lay on my bed. They used to read to me, and,
      among other things, some papers of &lsquo;The Rambler,&rsquo; which I liked not at
      all; its tripod sentences tired my ear, but I let them go on&mdash;as well
      one sound as another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It chanced that one night, as I was going to sleep, an eastern story in
      &lsquo;The Rambler,&rsquo; was read to me, about some man, a-weary of the world, who
      took to the peaceful hermitage. There was a regular moral tagged to the
      end of it, a thing I hate, the words were, &lsquo;No life pleasing to God that
      is not useful to man.&rsquo; When I wakened in the middle of that night, this
      sentence was before my eyes, and the words seemed to repeat themselves
      over and over again to my ears when I was sinking to sleep. The impression
      remained in my mind, and though I never voluntarily recurred to it, came
      out long afterwards, perfectly fresh, and became a motive of action.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strange, mysterious connection between mind and body; in mere animal
      nature we see the same. The bird wakened from his sleep to be taught a
      tune sung to him in the dark, and left to sleep again,&mdash;the
      impression rests buried within him, and weeks afterward he comes out with
      the tune perfect. But these are only phenomena of memory&mdash;mine was
      more extraordinary. I am not sure that I can explain it to you. In my weak
      state, my understanding enfeebled as much as my body&mdash;my reason
      weaker than my memory, I could not help allowing myself to think that the
      constant repetition of that sentence was a warning sent to me from above.
      As I grew stronger, the superstition died away, but the sense of the thing
      still remained with me. It led me to examine and reflect. It did more than
      all my mother&rsquo;s entreaties could effect. I had refused to see any human
      creature, but I now consented to admit a few. The charm was broken. I gave
      up my longing for solitude, my plan of retreat from the world; suffered
      myself to be carried where they pleased&mdash;to Brighton it was&mdash;to
      my mother&rsquo;s satisfaction. I was ready to appear in the ranks of fashion at
      the opening of the next London campaign. Automatically I &lsquo;ran my female
      exercises o&rsquo;er&rsquo; with as good grace as ever. I had followers and proposals;
      but my mother was again thrown into despair by what she called the short
      work I made with my admirers, scarcely allowing decent time for their
      turning into lovers before I warned them not to think of me. I have heard
      that women who have suffered from man&rsquo;s inconstancy are disposed
      afterwards to revenge themselves by inflicting pain such as they have
      themselves endured, and delight in all the cruelty of coquetry. It was not
      so with me. Mine was too deep a wound&mdash;skinned over&mdash;not
      callous, and all danger of its opening again I dreaded. I had lovers the
      more, perhaps, because I cared not for them; till amongst them there came
      one who, as I saw, appreciated my character, and, as I perceived, was
      becoming seriously attached. To prevent danger to his happiness, as he
      would take no other warning, I revealed to him the state of my mind.
      However humiliating the confession, I thought it due to him. I told him
      that I had no heart to give&mdash;that I had received none in return for
      that with which I had parted, and that love was over with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;As a passion, it may be so, not as an affection,&rsquo; was his reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The words opened to me a view of his character. I saw, too, by his love
      increasing with his esteem, the solidity of his understanding, and the
      nobleness of his nature. He went deeper and deeper into my mind, till he
      came to a spring of gratitude, which rose and overflowed, vivifying and
      fertilising the seemingly barren waste. I believe it to be true that,
      after the first great misfortune, persons never return to be the same that
      they were before, but this I know&mdash;and this it is important you
      should be convinced of, my dear Helen&mdash;that the mind, though sorely
      smitten, can recover its powers. A mind, I mean, sustained by good
      principles, and by them made capable of persevering efforts for its own
      recovery. It may be sure of regaining, in time&mdash;observe, I say in
      time&mdash;its healthful tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time was given to me by that kind, that noble being, who devoted himself
      to me with a passion which I could not return&mdash;but, with such
      affection as I could give, and which he assured me would make his
      happiness, I determined to devote to him the whole of my future existence.
      Happiness for me, I thought, was gone, except in so far as I could make
      him happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I married Lord Davenant&mdash;much against my mother&rsquo;s wish, for he was
      then the younger of three brothers, and with a younger brother&rsquo;s very
      small portion. Had it been a more splendid match, I do not think I could
      have been prevailed on to give my consent. I could not have been sure of
      my own motives, or rather my pride would not have been clear as to the
      opinion which others might form. This was a weakness, for in acting we
      ought to depend upon ourselves, and not to look for the praise or blame of
      others; but I let you see me as I am, or as I was: I do not insist, like
      Queen Elizabeth, in having my portrait without shade.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am proud to tell you, that at the time I married we were so poor, that
      I was obliged to give up many of those luxuries to which I was entitled,
      and to which I had been so accustomed, that the doing without them had
      till then hardly come within my idea of possibility. Our whole
      establishment was on the most humble scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I look back to this period of my life with the greatest satisfaction. I
      had exquisite pleasure, like all young people of sanguine temperament and
      generous disposition, in the consciousness of the capability of making
      sacrifices. This notion was my idol, the idol of the inmost sanctuary of
      my mind, and I worshipped it with all the energies of body and soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the course of a few years, my husband&rsquo;s two elder brothers died. If
      you have any curiosity to know how, I will tell you, though indeed it is
      as little to the purpose as half the things people tell in their
      histories. The eldest, a homebred lordling, who, from the moment he
      slipped his mother&rsquo;s apron-strings, had fallen into folly, and then, to
      show himself manly, run into vice, lost his life in a duel about some
      lady&rsquo;s crooked thumb, or more crooked mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The second brother distinguished himself in the navy; he died the death
      of honour; he fell gloriously, and was by his country honoured&mdash;by
      his country mourned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After the death of this young man, the inheritance came to my husband.
      Fortune soon after poured in upon us a tide of wealth, swelled by
      collateral streams.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will wish to know what effect this change of circumstances produced
      upon my mind, and you shall, as far as I know it myself. I fancied that it
      would have made none, because I had been before accustomed to all the
      trappings of wealth; yet it did make a greater change in my feelings than
      you could have imagined, or I could have conceived. The possibility of
      producing a great effect in society, of playing a distinguished part, and
      attaining an eminence which pleased my fancy, had never till now been
      within my reach. The incense of fame had been wafted near me, but not to
      me&mdash;near my husband I mean, yet not to him; I had heard his brother&rsquo;s
      name from the trumpet of fame, I longed to hear his own. I knew, what to
      the world was then unknown, his great talents for civil business, which,
      if urged into action, might make him distinguished as a statesman even
      beyond his hero brother, but I knew that in him ambition, if it ever
      awoke, must be awakened by love. Conscious of my influence, I determined
      to use it to the utmost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Davenant had not at that time taken any part in politics, but from
      his connections he could ask and obtain; and there was one in the world
      for whom I desired to obtain a favour of importance. It chanced that he,
      whom I have mentioned to you as my inconstant lover, now married to my
      lovely rival, was at this time in some difficulty about a command abroad.
      His connections, though of very high rank were not now in power. He had
      failed in some military exploit which had formerly been intrusted to him.
      He was anxious to retrieve his character; his credit, his whole fate in
      life, depended on his obtaining this appointment, which, at my request,
      was secured to him by Lord Davenant. The day it was obtained was, I think,
      the proudest of my life. I was proud of returning good for evil; that was
      a Christian pride, if pride can be Christian. I was proud of showing that
      in me there was none of the fury of a woman scorned&mdash;no sense of the
      injury of charms despised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it was not yet the fulness of success; it had pained me in the midst
      of my internal triumph, that my husband had been obliged to use
      intermediate powers to obtain that which I should have desired should have
      been obtained by his own. Why should not he be in that first place of
      rule? He could hold the balance with a hand as firm, an eye as just. That
      he should be in the House of Peers was little satisfaction to me, unless
      distinguished among his peers. It was this distinction that I burned to
      see obtained by Lord Davenant; I urged him forward then by all the motives
      which make ambition virtue. He was averse from public life, partly from
      indolence of temper, partly from sound philosophy: power was low in the
      scale in his estimate of human happiness; he saw how little can be
      effected of real good in public by any individual; he felt it scarcely
      worth his while to stir from his easy chair of domestic happiness.
      However, love urged him on, and inspired him, if not with ambition, at
      least with what looked like it in public. He entered the lists, and in the
      political tournament tilted successfully. Many were astonished, for, till
      they came against him in the joust, they had no notion of his weight, or
      of his skill in arms; and many seriously inclined to believe that Lord
      Davenant was only Lady Davenant in disguise, and all he said, wrote, and
      did, was attributed to me. Envy gratifies herself continually by thus
      shifting the merit from one person to another; in hopes that the actual
      quantity may be diminished, she tries to make out that it is never the
      real person, but somebody else who does that which is good. This silly,
      base propensity might have cost me dear, would have cost me my husband&rsquo;s
      affections, had he not been a man, as there are few, above all jealousy of
      female influence or female talent; in short, he knew his own superiority,
      and needed not to measure himself to prove his height. He is quite
      content, rather glad, that every body should set him down as a
      common-place character. Far from being jealous of his wife&rsquo;s ruling him,
      he was amused by the notion: it flattered his pride, and it was convenient
      to his indolence; it fell in, too, with his peculiar humour. The more I
      retired, the more I was put forward, he, laughing behind me, prompted and
      forbade me to look back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Helen, I am come to a point where ambition ceased to be virtue. But
      why should I tell you all this? no one is ever the better for the
      experience of another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I cannot believe that,&rdquo; cried Helen; &ldquo;pray, pray go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ambition first rose in my mind from the ashes of another passion. Fresh
      materials, of heterogeneous kinds, altered the colour, and changed the
      nature of the flame: I should have told you, but narrative is not my forte&mdash;I
      never can remember to tell things in their right order. I forgot to tell
      you, that when Madame de Staël&rsquo;s book, &lsquo;Sur la Revolution Française,&rsquo; came
      out, it made an extraordinary impression upon me. I turned, in the first
      place, as every body did, eagerly to the chapter on England, but, though
      my national feelings were gratified, my female pride was dreadfully
      mortified by what she says of the ladies of England; in fact, she could
      not judge of them. They were afraid of her. They would not come out of
      their shells. What she called timidity, and what I am sure she longed to
      call stupidity, was the silence of overawed admiration, or mixed curiosity
      and discretion. Those who did venture, had not full possession of their
      powers, or in a hurry showed them in a wrong direction. She saw none of
      them in their natural state. She asserts that, though there may be women
      distinguished as writers in England, there are no ladies who have any
      great conversational and political influence in society, of that kind
      which, during <i>l&rsquo;ancien régime</i>, was obtained in France by what they
      would call their <i>femmes marquantes</i>, such as Madame de Tencin,
      Madame du Deffand, Mademoiselle de l&rsquo;Espinasse. This remark stung me to
      the quick, for my country and for myself, and raised in me a foolish,
      vain-glorious emulation, an ambition false in its objects, and unsuited to
      the manners, domestic habits, and public virtue of our country. I ought to
      have been gratified by her observing, that a lady is never to be met with
      in England, as formerly in France, at the Bureau du Ministre; and that in
      England there has never been any example of a woman&rsquo;s having known in
      public affairs, or at least told, what ought to have been kept secret.
      Between ourselves, I suspect she was a little mistaken in some of these
      assertions; but, be that as it may, I determined to prove that she was
      mistaken; I was conscious that I had more within me than I had yet brought
      out; I did not doubt that I had eloquence, if I had but courage to produce
      it. It is really astonishing what a mischievous effect those few passages
      produced on my mind. In London, one book drives out another, one
      impression, however deep, is effaced by the next shaking of the sand; but
      I was then in the country, for, unluckily for me, Lord Davenant had been
      sent away on some special embassy. Left alone with my nonsense, I set
      about, as soon as I was able, to assemble an audience round me, to exhibit
      myself in the character of a female politician, and I believe I had a
      notion at the same time of being the English Corinne. Rochefoucault, the
      dexterous anatomist of self-love, says that we confess our small faults,
      to persuade the world that we have no large ones. But, for my part, I feel
      that there are some small faults more difficult to me to confess than any
      large ones. Affectation, for instance; it is something so little, so
      paltry, it is more than a crime, it is a ridicule: I believe I did make
      myself completely ridiculous; I am glad Lord Davenant was not by, it
      lasted but a short time. Our dear good friend Dumont (you knew Dumont at
      Florence?) could not bear to see it; his regard for Lord Davenant urged
      him the more to disenchant me, and bring me back, before his return, to my
      natural form. The disenchantment was rather rude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One evening, after I had been snuffing up incense till I was quite
      intoxicated, when my votaries had departed, and we were alone together, I
      said to him, &lsquo;Allow that this is what would be called at Paris, <i>un
      grand succés</i>.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dumont made no reply, but stood opposite to me playing in his peculiar
      manner with his great snuff-box, slowly swaying the snuff from side to
      side. Knowing this to be a sign that he was in some great dilemma, I asked
      of what he was thinking. &lsquo;Of you,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;And what of me?&rsquo; In his
      French accent he repeated those two provoking lines&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">  &lsquo;New wit, like wine, intoxicates the brain,<br />   Too strong for feeble women to sustain.&lsquo;<br /></pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;To my face?&rsquo; said I, smiling, for I tried to command my temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Better than behind your back, as others do,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Behind my back!&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;impossible.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Perfectly possible,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;as I could prove if you were strong
      enough to bear it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Quite strong enough,&rsquo; I said, and bade him speak on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Suppose you were offered,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;the fairy-ring that rendered the
      possessor invisible, and enabled him to hear every thing that was said,
      and all that was thought of him, would you throw it away, or put it on
      your finger?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Put it on my finger,&rsquo; I replied; &lsquo;and this instant, for a true friend is
      better than a magic ring, I put it on.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You are very brave,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;then you shall hear the lines I heard in
      a rival salon, repeated by him who last wafted the censer to you
      to-night.&rsquo; He repeated a kind of doggrel pasquinade, beginning with&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">  &lsquo;Tell me, gentles, have you seen,<br />  The prating she, the mock Corinne?&rsquo;<br /></pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dumont, who had the courage for my good to inflict the blow, could not
      stay to see its effect, and this time I was left alone, not with my
      nonsense, but with my reason. It was quite sufficient. I was cured. My
      only consolation in my disgrace was, that I honourably kept Dumont&rsquo;s
      counsel. The friend who composed the lampoon, from that day to this never
      knew that I had heard it; though I must own I often longed to tell him,
      when he was offering his incense again, that I wished he would reverse his
      practice, and let us have the satire in my presence, and keep the flattery
      for my absence. The graft of affectation, which was but a poor weak thing,
      fell off at once, but the root of the evil had not yet been reached. My
      friend Dumont had not cut deep enough, or perhaps feared to cut away too
      much that was sound and essential to life: my political ambition remained,
      and on Lord Davenant&rsquo;s return sprang up in full vigour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now it is all over, I can analyse and understand my own motives: when I
      first began my political course, I really and truly had no love for power;
      full of other feelings, I was averse from it; it was absolutely
      disagreeable to me; but as people acquire a taste for drams after making
      faces at first swallowing, so I, from experience of the excitation,
      acquired the habit, the love, of this mental dram-drinking; besides, I had
      such delightful excuses for myself: I didn&rsquo;t love power for its own sake,
      it was never used for myself, always for others; ever with my old
      principle of sacrifice in full play: this flattering unction I laid to my
      soul, and it long hid from me its weakness, its gradual corruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first instance in which I used my influence, and by my husband&rsquo;s
      intervention obtained a favour of some importance, the thing done, though
      actually obtained by private favour, was in a public point of view well
      done and fit to be done; but when in time Lord Davenant had reached that
      eminence which had been the summit of my ambition, and when once it was
      known that I had influence (and in making it known between jest and
      earnest Lord Davenant was certainly to blame), numbers of course were
      eager to avail themselves of the discovery, swarms born in the noontide
      ray, or such as salute the rising morn, buzzed round me. I was
      good-natured and glad to do the service, and proud to show that I could do
      it. I thought I had some right to share with Lord Davenant, at least, the
      honour and pleasures of patronage, and so he willingly allowed it to be,
      as long as my objects were well chosen, though he said to me once with a
      serious smile, &lsquo;The patronage of Europe would not satisfy you; you would
      want India, and if you had India, you would sigh for the New World.&rsquo; I
      only laughed, and said &lsquo;The same thought as Lord Chesterfield&rsquo;s, only more
      neatly put.&rsquo; &lsquo;If all Ireland were given to such a one for his patrimony,
      he&rsquo;d ask for the Isle of Man for his cabbage-garden.&rsquo; Lord Davenant did
      not smile. I felt a little alarmed, and a feeling of estrangement began
      between us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I recollect one day his seeing a note on my table from one of my <i>protegés</i>,
      thanking me outrageously, and extolling my very obliging disposition. He
      read, and threw it down, and with one of his dry-humour smiles repeated,
      half to himself,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">  And so obliging that she ne&rsquo;er obliged.&lsquo;<br /></pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought these lines were in the Characters of Women, and I hunted all
      through them in vain; at last I found them in the character of a man,
      which could not suit me, and I was pacified, and, what is extraordinary,
      my conscience quite put at ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The week afterwards I went to make some request for a friend: my little
      boy&mdash;for I had a dear little boy then&mdash;had come in along with
      mamma. Lord Davenant complied with my request, but unwillingly I saw, and
      as if he felt it a weakness; and, putting his hand upon the curly-pated
      little fellow&rsquo;s head, he said, &lsquo;This boy rules Greece, I see.&rsquo; The child
      was sent for the Grecian history, his father took him on his knee, while
      he read the anecdote, and as he ended he whispered in the child&rsquo;s ear,
      &lsquo;Tell mamma this must not be; papa should be ruled only by justice.&rsquo; He
      really had public virtue, I only talked of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After this you will wonder that I could go on, but I did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had at that time a friend, who talked always most romantically, and
      acted most selfishly, and for some time I never noticed the inconsistency
      between her words and actions. In fact she had two currents in her mind,
      two selves, one romantic from books, the other selfish from worldly
      education and love of fashion, and of the goods of this world. She had
      charming manners, which I thought went for nothing with me, but which I
      found stood for every thing. In short, she was as caressing, as graceful,
      in her little ways, and as selfish as a cat. She had claws too, but at
      first I only felt the velvet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was for this woman that I hazarded my highest happiness&mdash;my
      husband&rsquo;s esteem, and for the most paltry object imaginable. She wanted
      some petty place for some man who was to marry her favourite maid. When I
      first mentioned it to him, Lord Davenant coldly said, &lsquo;It can&rsquo;t be done,&rsquo; 
      and his pen went on very quickly with the letter he was writing. Vexed and
      ashamed, and the more vexed because ashamed, I persisted. &lsquo;Cannot be done
      for <i>me</i>?&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;Not for anybody,&rsquo; said he&mdash;&lsquo;by me, at
      least.&rsquo;&mdash;I thought&mdash;Helen, I am ashamed to tell you what I
      thought; but I will tell it you, because it will show you how a mind may
      be debased by the love of power, or rather by the consequence which its
      possession bestows. I thought he meant to point out to me that, although
      he would not do it, I might <i>get it done</i>. And, speaking as if to
      myself, I said, &lsquo;Then I&rsquo;ll go to such a person; then I&rsquo;ll use such and
      such ways and means.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looking up from his writing at me, with a look such as I had never seen
      from him before, he replied, in the words of a celebrated minister, <i>&lsquo;C&rsquo;est
      facile de se servir de pareils moyens, c&rsquo;est difficile de s&rsquo;y resoudre.&lsquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I admired him, despised myself, left the room, and went and told my
      friend decidedly it could not be done. That instant, she became my enemy,
      and I felt her claws. I was proud of the wounds, and showed them to my
      husband. Now, Helen, you think I am cured for ever, and safe. Alas! no, my
      dear, it is not so easy to cure habit. I have, however, some excuse&mdash;let
      me put it forward; the person for whom I again transgressed was my mother,
      and for her I was proud of doing the utmost, because she had, as I could
      not forget, been ready to sacrifice my happiness to her speculations. She
      had left off building castles in the air, but she had outbuilt herself on
      earth. She had often recourse to me in her difficulties, and I supplied
      funds, as well I might, for I had a most liberal allowance from my most
      liberal lord; but schemes of my own, very patriotic but not overwise, had
      in process of time drained my purse. I had a school at Cecilhurst, and a
      lace manufactory; and to teach my little girls I must needs bring over
      lace-makers from Flanders, and Lisle thread, at an enormous expense: I
      shut my lace-makers up in a room (for secrecy was necessary), where, like
      spiders, they quarrelled with each other and fought, and the whole failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another scheme, very patriotic too, cost me an immensity: trying to make
      Indian cachemires in England, very beautiful they were, but they left not
      the tenth part of a penny in my private purse, and then my mother wanted
      some thousands for a new dairy; dairies were then the fashion, and hers
      was to be floored with the finest Dutch tiles, furnished with Sevre china,
      with plate glass windows, and a porch hung with French mirrors; so she set
      me to represent to Lord Davenant her very distressed situation, and to
      present a petition from her for a pension. The first time I urged my
      mother&rsquo;s request, Lord Davenant said, &lsquo;I am sure, Anne, that you do not
      know what you are asking.&rsquo; I desisted. I did not indeed well understand
      the business, nor at all comprehend that I was assisting a fraudulent
      attempt to obtain public money for a private purpose, but I wished to have
      the triumph of success, I wished to feel my own influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had it been foretold to me that I could so forget myself in the
      intoxication of political power, how I should have disdained the prophecy&mdash;&lsquo;Lord,
      is thy servant a dog, that he should do this thing?&rsquo; There is a fine
      sermon of Blair&rsquo;s on this subject; it had early made a great impression
      upon me; but what are good impressions, good feelings, good impulses, good
      intentions, good any thing, without principle?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother wondered how I could so easily take a refusal; she piqued my
      pride by observing that she was sorry my influence had declined; her pity,
      so near contempt, wounded me, and I unadvisedly exclaimed that my
      influence had in no way declined. Scarcely had I uttered the words, when I
      saw the inference to which they laid me open, that I had not used my
      influence to the utmost for her. My mother had quite sense and just
      feeling enough to refrain from marking this in words. She noted it only by
      an observing look, followed by a sigh. She confessed that I had always
      been so kind, so much kinder than she could have expected, that she would
      say no more. This was more to the purpose with me than if she had talked
      for hours. I heard fresh sighs, and saw tears begin to flow&mdash;a
      mother&rsquo;s sighs and tears it is difficult, and I felt it was shameful, to
      bear. I was partly melted, much confused, and hurried, too, by visitors
      coming in, and I hastily promised that I would try once more what I could
      do. The moment I had time for reflection I repented of what I had
      promised. But the words were past recall. It was so disagreeable to me to
      speak about the affair to my husband, that I wanted to get it off my mind
      as soon as possible, but the day passed without my being able to find a
      moment when I could speak to Lord Davenant in private. Company stayed till
      late, my mother the latest. At parting, as she kissed me, calling me her
      dearest Anne, she said she was convinced I could do whatever I pleased
      with Lord Davenant, and as she was going down stairs, added, she was sure
      the first words she should hear from me in the morning would be &lsquo;Victory,
      victory!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hated myself for admitting the thought, and yet there it was; I let it
      in, and could not get it out. From what an indescribable mixture of weak
      motives or impulses, and often without one reasonable principle, do we act
      in the most important moments of life. Even as I opened the door of his
      room I hesitated, my heart beat forebodingly, but I thought I could not
      retreat, and I went in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was standing on the hearth looking weary, but a reviving smile came on
      seeing me, and he held out his hand&mdash;&lsquo;My comfort always,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I took his hand, and, hesitating, was again my better self; but I would
      not go back, nor could I begin with any preface.&mdash;Thank Heaven that
      was impossible. I began:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Davenant, I am come to ask you a favour, and you must do it for me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I hope it is in my power, my dear,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;I am sure you would not
      ask&mdash;&rsquo; and there he stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told him it was in his power, and that I would not ask it for any
      creature living, but&mdash;&rsquo; He put his hand upon my lips, told me he knew
      what I was going to say, and begged me not to say it; but I, hoping to
      carry it off playfully, kissed his hand, and putting it aside said, &lsquo;I
      must ask, and you must grant this to my mother.&rsquo; He replied, &lsquo;It cannot
      be, Anne, consistently with public justice, and with my public duty. I&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Nonsense, nonsense,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;such words are only to mask a refusal.&rsquo; <i>Mask</i>,
      I remember, was the word that hurt him. Of all I could have used, it was
      the worst: I knew it the instant I had said it. Lord Davenant stepped
      back, and with such a look! You, Helen, who have seen only his benign
      countenance, his smiling eyes, cannot conceive it. I am sure he must have
      seen how much it alarmed me, for suddenly it changed, and I saw all the
      melting softness of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh fool! vain wicked fool that I was! I thought of &lsquo;victory,&rsquo; and pursued
      it. My utmost power of persuasion&mdash;words&mdash;smiles&mdash;and tears
      I tried&mdash;and tried in vain; and then I could not bear to feel that I
      had in vain made this trial of power and love. Shame and pride and anger
      seized me by turns, and raised such a storm within me&mdash;such confusion&mdash;that
      I knew not what I did or said. And he was so calm! looked so at least,
      though I am sure he was not. His self-possession piqued and provoked me
      past all bearing. I cannot tell you exactly how it was&mdash;it was so
      dreadfully interesting to me that I am unable to recall the exact words;
      but I remember at last hearing him say, in a voice I had never before
      heard, &lsquo;Lady Davenant!&rsquo;&mdash;He had never called me so before; he had
      always called me &lsquo;Anne:&rsquo; it seemed as if he had dismissed me from his
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Call me Anne! O call me Anne!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he yielded instantly, he called me Anne, and caressing me, &lsquo;his
      Anne.&rsquo; &lsquo;O Helen! never do as I did.&rsquo; I whispered, &lsquo;Then, my love, you will
      do this for me&mdash;for me, your own Anne?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He put me gently away, and leaned against the chimney-piece in silence.
      Then turning to me, in a low suppressed voice, he said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I have loved you&mdash;love you as much as man can love woman, there is
      nothing I would not sacrifice for you except&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No exceptions!&rsquo; cried I, in an affected tone of gaiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Except honour,&rsquo; he repeated firmly.&mdash;Helen, my dear, you are of a
      generous nature, so am I, but the demon of pride was within me, it made me
      long to try the extent of my power. Disappointed, I sunk to meanness;
      never, never, however tempted, however provoked, never do as I did, never
      reproach a friend with any sacrifice you have made for them; this is a
      meanness which your friend may forgive, but which you can never forgive
      yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reproached him with the sacrifice of my feelings, which I had made in
      marrying him! His answer was, &lsquo;I feel that what you say is true, I am now
      convinced you are incapable of loving me; and since I cannot make you
      happy, we had better&mdash;part.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These were the last words I heard. The blow was wholly unexpected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whether I sunk down, or threw myself at his feet, I know not; but when I
      came to myself he was standing beside me. There were other faces, but my
      eyes saw only his: I felt his hand holding mine, I pressed it, and said,
      &lsquo;Forget.&rsquo; He stooped down and whispered, &lsquo;It is forgotten.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe there is nothing can touch a generous mind so much as the being
      treated with perfect generosity&mdash;nothing makes us so deeply feel our
      own fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Davenant was here so much moved that she could say no more. By an
      involuntary motion, she checked the reins, and the horses stopped, and she
      continued quite silent for a few minutes: at length two or three deeply
      drawn sighs seemed to relieve her; she looked up, and her attention seemed
      to be caught by a bird that was singing sweetly on a branch over their
      heads. She asked what bird it was? Helen showed it to her where it sat:
      she looked up and smiled, touched the horses with her whip, and went on
      where she had left off.&mdash;&ldquo;The next thing was the meeting my mother in
      the morning; I prepared myself for it, and thought I was now armed so
      strong in honesty that I could go through with it well: my morality,
      however, was a little nervous, was fluttered by the knock at the door,
      and, when I heard her voice as she came towards my room, asking eagerly if
      I was alone, I felt a sickness at the certainty that I must at once crush
      her hopes. But I stood resolved; my eyes fixed on the door through which
      she was to enter. She came in, to my astonishment, with a face radiant
      with joy, and hastening to me she embraced me with the warmest expression
      of fondness and gratitude.&mdash;I stood petrified as I heard her talk of
      my kindness&mdash;my generosity. I asked what she could mean, said there
      must be some mistake. But holding before my eyes a note, &lsquo;Can there be any
      mistake in this?&rsquo; said she. That note, for I can never forget it, I will
      repeat to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What you wish can be done in a better manner than you proposed. The
      public must have no concern with it; Lady Davenant must have the pleasure
      of doing it her own way; an annuity to the amount required shall be
      punctually paid to your banker. The first instalment will be in his hands
      by the time you receive this.&mdash;DAVENANT.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I had been formerly disenchanted from my trance of love, the
      rudeness of the shock had benumbed all my faculties, and left me scarcely
      power to think; but now, when thus recovered from the delirium of power, I
      was immediately in perfect possession of my understanding, and when I was
      made to comprehend the despicable use I would have made of my influence,
      or the influence my husband possessed, I was so shocked, that I have ever
      since, I am conscious, in speaking of any political corruption, rather
      exaggerated my natural abhorrence of it. Not from the mean and weak idea
      of convincing the world how foreign all such wrong was to my soul, but
      because it really is foreign to it, because I know how it can debase the
      most honourable characters; I feel so much shocked at the criminal as at
      the crime, because I saw it once in all its hideousness so near myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A change in the ministry took place this year, Lord Davenant&rsquo;s
      resignation was sent in and accepted, and in retirement I had not only
      leisure to be good, but also leisure to cultivate my mind. Of course I had
      read all such reading as ladies read, but this was very different from the
      kind of study that would enable me to keep pace with Lord Davenant and his
      highly informed friends. Many of these, more men of thought than of show,
      visited us from time to time in the country. Though I had passed very well
      in London society, blue, red, and green, literary, fashionable, and
      political, and had been extolled as both witty and wise, especially when
      my husband was in place; yet when I came into close contact with minds of
      a higher order, I felt my own deficiencies. Lord Davenant&rsquo;s superiority I
      particularly perceived in the solidity of the ground he uniformly took and
      held in reasoning. And when I, too confident, used to venture rashly, and
      often found myself surrounded, and in imminent danger in argument, he used
      to bring me off and ably cover my retreat, and looked so pleased, so
      proud, when I made a happy hit, or jumped to a right conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what I most liked, most admired, in him was, that he never triumphed
      or took unfair advantages on the strength of his learning, of his
      acquirements, or of what I may call his logical training.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mention these seeming trifles because it is not always in the great
      occasions of life that a generous disposition shows itself in the way
      which we most feel. Little instances of generosity shown in this way,
      unperceived by others, have gone most deeply into my mind; and have most
      raised my opinion of his character. The sense that I was over rather than
      under valued, made me the more ready to acknowledge and feel my own
      deficiencies. I felt the truth of an aphorism of Lord Verulam&rsquo;s, which is
      now come down to the copy-books; that &lsquo;knowledge is power.&rsquo; Having made
      this notable discovery, I set about with all my might to acquire
      knowledge. You may smile, and think that this was only in a new form the
      passion for power; no, it was something better. Not to do myself
      injustice, I now felt the pure desire of knowledge, and enjoyed the pure
      pleasure of obtaining it; assisted, supported, and delighted, by the
      sympathy of a superior mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to intellectual happiness, this was the happiest time of my life. As
      if my eyes had been rubbed by your favourite dervise in the Arabian tales,
      with this charmed ointment, which opened at once to view all the treasures
      of the earth, I saw and craved the boundless treasures opened to my view.
      I now wanted to read all that Lord Davenant was reading, that I might be
      up to his ideas, but this was not to be done in an instant. There was a
      Frenchwoman who complained that she never could learn any thing, because
      she could not find anybody to teach her all she wanted to know in two
      words. I was not quite so <i>exigeante</i> as this lady; but, after having
      skated on easily and rapidly, far on the superficies of knowledge, it was
      difficult and rather mortifying to have to go back and begin at the
      beginning. Yet, when I wanted to go a little deeper, and really to
      understand what I was about, this was essentially necessary. I could not
      have got through without the assistance of one who showed me what I might
      safely leave unlearned, and who pointed out what fruit was worth climbing
      for, what would only turn to ashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This happy time of my life too quickly passed away. It was interrupted,
      however, not by any fault or folly of my own, but by an infliction from
      the hand of Providence, to which I trust I submitted with resignation&mdash;we
      lost our dear little boy; my second boy was born dead, and my confinement
      was followed by long and severe illness. I was ordered to try the air of
      Devonshire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One night&mdash;now, my dear, I have kept for the last the only romantic
      incident in my life&mdash;one night, a vessel was wrecked upon our coast;
      one of the passengers, a lady, an invalid, was brought to our house; I
      hastened to her assistance&mdash;it was my beautiful rival!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was in a deep decline, and had been at Lisbon for some time, but she
      was now sent home by the physicians, as they send people from one country
      to another to die. The captain of the ship in which she was mistook the
      lights upon the coast, and ran the ship ashore near to our house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course we did for her all we could, but she was dying: she knew
      nothing of my history, and I trust I soothed her last moments&mdash;she
      died in my arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She had one child, a son, then at Eton: we sent for him; he arrived too
      late; the feeling he showed interested us deeply; we kept him with us some
      time; he was grateful; and afterwards as he grew up he often wrote to me.
      His letters you have read.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Beauclerc!&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Beauclerc.&mdash;I had not seen him for some time, when General
      Clarendon presented him to me as his ward at Florence, where I had
      opportunities of essentially serving him. You may now understand, my dear,
      why I had expected that Mr. Granville Beauclerc might have preferred
      coming to Clarendon Park this last month of my stay in England to the
      pleasures of London. I was angry, I own, but after five minutes&rsquo; grace I
      cooled, saw that I must be mistaken, and came to the just conclusion of
      the old poet, that no one sinks at once to the depth of ill, and
      ingratitude I consider as the depth of ill. I opine, therefore, that some
      stronger feeling than friendship now operates to detain Granville
      Beauclerc. In that case I forgive him, but, for his own sake, and with
      such a young man I should say for the sake of society&mdash;of the public
      good&mdash;for he will end in public life, I hope the present object is
      worthy of him, whoever she may be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I anything more to tell you? Yes, I should say that, when by changes
      in the political world Lord Davenant was again in power, I had learned, if
      not to be less ambitious, at least to show it less. D&mdash;&mdash;, who
      knew always how to put sense into my mind, so that I found it there, and
      thought it completely my own, had once said that &lsquo;every public man who has
      a cultivated and high-minded wife, has in fact two selves, each holding
      watch and ward for the other.&rsquo; The notion pleased me&mdash;pleased both my
      fancy and my reason; I acted on it, and Lord Davenant assures me that I
      have been this second self to him, and I am willing to believe it, first
      because he is a man of strict truth, and secondly, because every woman is
      willing to believe what she wishes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Davenant paused, and after some minutes of reflection said, &ldquo;I
      confess, however, that I have not reason to be quite satisfied with myself
      as a mother; I did not attend sufficiently to Cecilia&rsquo;s early education:
      engrossed with politics, I left her too much to governesses, at one period
      to a very bad one. I have done what I can to remedy this, and you have
      done more perhaps; but I much fear that the early neglect can never be
      completely repaired; she is, however, married to a man of sense, and when
      I go to Russia I shall think with satisfaction that I leave you with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After expressing how deeply she had been interested in all that she had
      heard, and how grateful she felt for the confidence reposed in her, Helen
      said she could not help wishing that Cecilia knew all that had been just
      told her of Lady Davenant&rsquo;s history. If Cecilia could but know all the
      tenderness of her mother&rsquo;s heart, how much less would she fear, how much
      more would she love her!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would answer no purpose,&rdquo; replied Lady Davenant; &ldquo;there are persons
      with intrinsic differences of character, who, explain as you will, can
      never understand one another beyond a certain point. Nature and art forbid&mdash;no
      spectacles you can furnish will remedy certain defects of vision. Cecilia
      sees as much as she can ever see of my character, and I see, in the best
      light, the whole of hers. So Helen, my dear, take the advice of a Scotch
      proverb&mdash;proverbs are vulgar, because they usually contain common
      sense&mdash;&lsquo;Let well alone.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are really a very good little friend,&rdquo; added she, &ldquo;but keep my
      personal narrative for your own use.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was late before they reached home, and Helen dressed as fast as
      possible, for the general&rsquo;s punctual habits required that all should
      assemble in the drawing-room five minutes at least before dinner. She was
      coming down the private turret staircase, which led from the family
      apartments to the great hall, when, just at the turn, and in the most
      awkward way possible, she met a gentleman, a stranger, where never
      stranger had been seen by her before, running up full speed, so that they
      had but barely space and time to clear out of each other&rsquo;s way. Pardons
      were begged of course. The manner and voice of the stranger were
      particularly gentlemanlike. A servant followed with his portmanteau,
      inquiring into which room Mr. Beauclerc was to go?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Beauclerc!&rdquo;&mdash;When Helen got to the drawing-room, and found that
      not even the general was there, she thought she could have time to run up
      the great staircase to Lady Davenant&rsquo;s room, and tell her that Mr.
      Beauclerc was come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Lady Davenant, Mr. Beauclerc!&rdquo;&mdash;He was there! and she made
      her retreat as quickly as possible. The quantity that had been said about
      him, and the awkward way in which they had thus accidentally met, made her
      feel much embarrassed when they were regularly introduced.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the beginning of dinner, Helen fancied that there was unusual silence
      and constraint; perhaps this might be so, or perhaps people were really
      hungry, or perhaps Mr. Beauclerc had not yet satisfied the general and
      Lady Davenant: however, towards the end of dinner, and at the dessert, he
      was certainly entertaining; and Lady Cecilia appeared particularly amused
      by an account which he was giving of a little French piece he had seen
      just before he left London, called &ldquo;Les Premieres Amours,&rdquo; and Helen might
      have been amused too, but that Lady Cecilia called upon her to listen,
      and, Mr. Beauclerc turning his eyes upon her, she saw, or fancied that he
      was put out in his story, and though he went on with perfect good
      breeding, yet it was evidently with diminished spirit. As soon as
      politeness permitted, at the close of the story, she, to relieve him and
      herself, turned to the aide-de-camp on her other side, and devoted, or
      seemed to devote, to him her exclusive attention. He was always tiresome
      to her, but now more than ever; he went on, when once set a-going, about
      his horses and his dogs, while she had the mortification of hearing almost
      immediately after her seceding, that Mr. Beauclerc recovered the life and
      spirit of his tone, and was in full and delightful enjoyment of
      conversation with Lady Cecilia. Something very entertaining caught her ear
      every now and then; but, with her eyes fixed in the necessary direction,
      it was impossible to make it out, through the aid-de-camp&rsquo;s never-ending
      tediousness. She thought the sitting after dinner never would terminate,
      though it was in fact rather shorter than usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as they reached the drawing-room, Lady Cecilia asked her mother
      what was the cause of Granville&rsquo;s delay in town, and why he had come
      to-day, after he had written it was impossible?
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Davenant answered, that he had &lsquo;trampled,&rsquo; as Lord Chatham did, &lsquo;on
      impossibilities.&rsquo; &ldquo;It was not a physical impossibility, it seems.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure&mdash;I hope,&rdquo; continued Cecilia, &ldquo;that none of the Beltravers&rsquo; 
      set had any thing to do with his delay, yet from a word or two the general
      let fall, I&rsquo;m almost sure that they have&mdash;Lady Blanche, I&rsquo;m afraid&mdash;.&rdquo;
       There she stopped. &ldquo;If it were only a money difficulty with Lord
      Beltravers,&rdquo; resumed she, &ldquo;that might be easily settled, for Beauclerc is
      rich enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant, &ldquo;but rashly generous; an uncommon fault in
      these days, when young men are in general selfishly prudent or selfishly
      extravagant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; said Cecilia,&mdash;&ldquo;I hope Lady Blanche Forrester will not&mdash;&rdquo;
       there she paused, and consulted her mother&rsquo;s countenance; her mother
      answered that Beauclerc had not spoken to her of Lady Blanche. After
      putting her hopes and fears, questions and conjectures, into every
      possible form and direction, Lady Cecilia was satisfied that her mother
      knew no more than herself, and this was a great comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Beauclerc reappeared, Helen was glad that she was settled at an
      embroidery frame, at the furthest end of the room, as there, apart from
      the world, she felt safe from all cause for embarrassment, and there she
      continued happy till some one came to raise the light of the lamp over her
      head. It was Mr. Beauclerc, and, as she looked up, she gave a foolish
      little start of surprise, and then all her confusion returning, with
      thanks scarce audible, her eyes were instantly fixed on the vine leaf she
      was embroidering. He asked how she could by lamplight distinguish blue
      from green? a simple and not very alarming question, but she did not hear
      the words rightly, and thinking he asked whether she wished for a screen,
      she answered &ldquo;No, thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia laughed, and covering Helen&rsquo;s want of hearing by Beauclerc&rsquo;s
      want of sight, explained&mdash;&ldquo;Do not you see, Granville, the silk-cards
      are written upon, &lsquo;blue&rsquo; and &lsquo;green;&rsquo; there can be no mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Beauclerc made a few more laudable attempts at conversation with Miss
      Stanley, but she, still imagining that this was forced, could not in
      return say anything but what seemed forced and unnatural, and as unlike
      her usual self as possible. Lady Cecilia tried to relieve her; she would
      have done better to have let it alone, for Beauclerc was not of the French
      wit&rsquo;s opinion that, <i>La modestie n&rsquo;est bonne qu&rsquo;à quinze ans</i>, and to
      him it appeared only a graceful timidity. Helen retired earlier than any
      one else, and, when she thought over her foolish awkwardness, felt as much
      ashamed as if Mr. Beauclerc had actually heard all that Lady Cecilia had
      said about him&mdash;had seen all her thoughts, and understood the reason
      of her confusion. At last, when Lady Cecilia came into her room before she
      went to bed, she began with&mdash;&ldquo;I am sure you are going to scold me,
      and I deserve it, I am so provoked with myself, and the worst of it is,
      that I do not think I shall ever get over it&mdash;I am afraid I shall be
      just as foolish again tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could find it in my heart to scold you to death,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia,
      &ldquo;but that I am vexed myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then hesitating, and studying Helen&rsquo;s countenance, she seemed doubtful how
      to proceed. Either she was playing with Helen&rsquo;s curiosity, or she was
      really herself perplexed. She made two or three beginnings, each a little
      inconsistent with the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma is always right; with her&mdash;&lsquo;coming events&rsquo; really and truly
      &lsquo;cast their shadows before.&rsquo; I do believe she has the fatal gift, the
      coming ill to know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ill!&rdquo; said Helen; &ldquo;what ill is coming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all, however, it may not be an ill,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia; &ldquo;it may be
      all for the best; yet I am shockingly disappointed, though I declare I
      never formed any&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear Cecilia, do tell me at once what it is you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean, that Granville Beauclerc, like all men of genius, has acted like
      the greatest fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has he done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is absolutely&mdash;you must look upon him in future&mdash;as a
      married man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen was delighted. Cecilia could form no farther schemes on her account,
      and she felt relieved from all her awkwardness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest Helen, this is well at all events,&rdquo; cried Cecilia, seeing her
      cleared countenance. &ldquo;This comforts me; you are at ease; and, if I have
      caused you one uncomfortable evening, I am sure you are consoled for it by
      the reflection that my mother was right, and I, as usual, wrong. But,
      Helen,&rdquo; continued she earnestly, &ldquo;remember that this is not to be known;
      remember you must not breathe the least hint of what I have told you to
      mamma or the general.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something more than astonishment appeared in Helen&rsquo;s countenance. &ldquo;And is
      it possible that Mr. Beauclerc does not tell them,&mdash;does not trust
      his guardian and such a friend as your mother?&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will tell them, he will tell them&mdash;but not yet; perhaps not till&mdash;he
      is not to see his fiancée&mdash;they have for some reason agreed to be
      separated for some time&mdash;I do not know exactly, but surely every body
      may choose their own opportunity for telling their own secrets. In fact,
      Helen, the lady, I understand, made it a point with him that nothing
      should be said of it yet&mdash;to any one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he told it to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed, he did not tell it; I found it out, and he could not deny it;
      but he charged me to keep it secret, and I would not have told it to any
      body living but yourself; and to you, after all I said about him, I felt
      it was necessary&mdash;thought I was bound&mdash;in short, I thought it
      would set things to rights, and put you at your ease at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then, with more earnestness, she again pressed upon Helen a promise of
      secrecy, especially towards Lady Davenant. Helen submitted. Cecilia
      embraced her affectionately, and left the room. Quite tired, and quite
      happy, Helen was in bed and asleep in a few minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not the slightest suspicion crossed her mind that all her friend had been
      telling her was not perfectly true. To a more practised, a less confiding,
      person the perplexity of Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s prefaces, and some contradictions
      or inconsistencies, might have suggested doubts; but Helen&rsquo;s general
      confidence in her friend&rsquo;s truth had never yet been seriously shaken. Lady
      Davenant she had always thought prejudiced on this point, and too severe.
      If there had been in early childhood a bad habit of inaccuracy in Cecilia,
      Helen thought it long since cured; and so perhaps it was, till she formed
      a friendship abroad with one who had no respect for truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      But of this Helen knew nothing; and, in fact, till now Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s
      aberrations had been always trifling, almost imperceptible, errors, such
      as only her mother&rsquo;s strictness or Miss Clarendon&rsquo;s scrupulosity could
      detect. Nor would Cecilia have ventured upon a decided, an important,
      false assertion, except for a kind purpose. Never in her life had she told
      a falsehood to injure any human creature, or one that she could foresee
      might, by any possibility do harm to any living being. But here was a
      friend, a very dear friend, in an awkward embarrassment, and brought into
      it by her means; and by a little innocent stretching of the truth she
      could at once, she fancied, set all to rights. The moment the idea came
      into her head, upon the spur of the occasion, she resolved to execute it
      directly. It was settled between the drawing-room door and her
      dressing-room. And when thus executed successfully, with happy sophistry
      she justified it to herself. &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; said she to herself, &ldquo;though it
      was not absolutely true, it was <i>ben trovato</i>, it was as near the
      truth, perhaps, as possible. Beauclerc&rsquo;s best friends really feared that
      he was falling in love with the lady in question. It was very likely, and
      too likely, it might end in his marrying this Lady Blanche Forrester. And,
      on every account, and every way, it was for the best that Helen should
      consider him as a married man. This would restore Helen by one magical
      stroke to herself, and release her from that wretched state in which she
      could neither please nor be pleased.&rdquo; And as far as this good effect upon
      Helen was concerned, Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s plan was judicious; it succeeded
      admirably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wonderful! how a few words spoken, a single idea taken, out of or put into
      the mind, can make such a difference, not only in the mental feelings, but
      in the whole bodily appearance, and in the actual powers of perception and
      use of our senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Helen entered the breakfast-room the next morning, she looked, and
      moved, and felt, quite a different creature from what she had been the
      preceding day. She had recovered the use of her understanding, and she
      could hear and see quite distinctly; and the first thing she saw was, that
      nobody was thinking particularly about her; and now she for the first time
      actually saw Mr. Beauclerc. She had before looked at him without seeing
      him, and really did not know what sort of looking person he was, except
      that he was like a gentleman; of that she had a sort of intuitive
      perception;&mdash;as Cuvier could tell from the first sight of a single
      bone what the animal was, what were its habits, and to what class it
      belonged, so any person early used to good company can, by the first
      gesture, the first general manner of being, passive or active, tell
      whether a stranger, even scarcely seen, is or is not a gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the beginning of breakfast, Mr. Beauclerc had all the perfect English
      quiet of look and manners, with somewhat of a high-bred air of
      indifference to all sublunary things, yet saying and doing whatever was
      proper for the present company; yet it was done and said like one in a
      dream, performed like a somnambulist, correctly from habit, but all
      unconsciously. He awakened from his reverie the moment General Clarendon
      came in, and he asked eagerly,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General! how far is it to Old Forest?&rdquo; These were the first words which
      he pronounced like one wide awake. &ldquo;I must ride there this morning; it&rsquo;s
      absolutely necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general replied that he did not see the necessity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But when I do, sir,&rdquo; cried Beauclerc; the natural vivacity of the young
      man breaking through the conventional manner. Next moment, with a humble
      look, he hoped that the general would accompany him, and the look of proud
      humility vanished from his countenance the next instant, because the
      general demurred, and Beauclerc added, &ldquo;Will not you oblige me so far?
      Then I must go by myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general, seeming to go on with his own thoughts, and not to be moved
      by his ward&rsquo;s impatience, talked of a review that was to be put off, and
      at length found that he could accompany him. Beauclerc then, delighted,
      thanked him warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the object of this essential visit to Old Forest, may I ask?&rdquo;
       said Lady Davenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To see a dilapidated house,&rdquo; said the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To save a whole family from ruin,&rdquo; cried Beauclerc; &ldquo;to restore a man of
      first-rate talents to his place in society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; said the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why that contemptuous exclamation, my dear general?&rdquo; said Beauclerc.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told you, and again I tell you, the thing is impossible!&rdquo; said the
      general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I hear you say, sir,&rdquo; replied his ward; &ldquo;but till I am convinced, I
      hold to my project.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is your project, Granville?&rdquo; said Lady Davenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will explain it to you when we are alone,&rdquo; said Beauclerc.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, I was not aware that there was any mystery,&rdquo; said Lady
      Davenant. &ldquo;No mystery,&rdquo; said Beauclerc, &ldquo;only about lending some money to
      a friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To which I will not consent,&rdquo; said the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not, sir?&rdquo; said Beauclerc, throwing back his head with an air of
      defiance in his countenance; there was as he looked at his guardian a
      quick, mutable succession of feelings, in striking contrast with the
      fixity of the general&rsquo;s appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have given you my reasons, Beauclerc,&rdquo; said the general, &ldquo;It is
      unnecessary to repeat what I have said, you will do no good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No good, general? When I tell you that if I lend Beltravers the money, to
      put his place in repair, to put it in such a state that his sisters could
      live in it, he would no longer be a banished man, a useless absentee, a
      wanderer abroad, but he would come and settle at Old Forest, re-establish
      the fortune and respectability of his family, and above all, save his own
      character and happiness. Oh, my dear general!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      General Clarendon, evidently moved by his ward&rsquo;s benevolent enthusiasm,
      paused and said that there were many recollections which made it rather
      painful to him to revisit Old Forest. Still he would do it for Beauclerc,
      since nothing but seeing the place would convince him of the
      impracticability of his scheme. &ldquo;I have not been at Old Forest,&rdquo; continued
      the general, &ldquo;since I was a boy&mdash;since it was deserted by the owners,
      and sadly changed I shall find it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In former times these Forresters were a respectable, good old English
      family, till the second wife, pretty and silly, took a fancy for figuring
      in London, where of course she was nobody. Then, to make herself somebody,
      she forced her husband to stand for the county. A contested election&mdash;bribery&mdash;a
      petition&mdash;another election&mdash;ruinous expense. Then that
      Beltravers title coming to them: and they were to live up to it,&mdash;and
      beyond their income. The old story&mdash;over head and shoulders in debt.
      Then the new story,&mdash;that they must go abroad for economy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Economy! The cant of all those who have not courage to retrench at home,&rdquo;
       said Lady Davenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They must,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;live abroad, it is so cheap,&rdquo; continued the
      general. &ldquo;So cheap to leave their house to go to ruin! Cheap education
      too! and so good&mdash;and what does it come to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A cheap provision it is for a family in many cases,&rdquo; said Lord Davenant.
      &ldquo;Wife, son, and daughter, Satan, are thy own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in this case,&rdquo; cried Beauclerc; &ldquo;you cannot mean I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can answer for one, the daughter at least,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant; &ldquo;that
      Mad. de St. Cimon, whom we saw abroad, at Florence, you know, Cecilia,
      with whom I would not let you form an acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your ladyship was quite right,&rdquo; said the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauclerc could not say, &ldquo;Quite wrong,&rdquo;&mdash;and he looked&mdash;suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing of the son,&rdquo; pursued Lady Davenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Beauclerc, &ldquo;he is my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought he had been a very distressed man, that young Beltravers,&rdquo; said
      the aid-de-camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if he were, that would not prevent my being his friend, sir,&rdquo; said
      Beauclerc.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said the aid-de-camp, &ldquo;I only asked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a man of genius and feeling,&rdquo; continued Beauclerc, turning to Lady
      Davenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I never heard you mention Lord Beltravers before. How long has he
      been your friend?&rdquo; said Lady Davenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauclerc hesitated. The general without hesitation answered, &ldquo;Three weeks
      and one day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not count my friendship by days or weeks,&rdquo; said Beauclerc.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear Beauclerc,&rdquo; said the general: &ldquo;well would it be for you if
      you would condescend to any such common-sense measure.&rdquo; He rose from the
      breakfast-table as he spoke, and rang the bell to order the horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are prejudiced against Beltravers, general; but you will think better
      of him, I am sure, when you know him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will think worse of him when you know him, I suspect,&rdquo; replied the
      general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suspect! But since you only <i>suspect</i>,&rdquo; said Beauclerc, &ldquo;we English
      do not condemn on suspicion, unheard, unseen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not unheard,&rdquo; said the general, &ldquo;I have heard enough of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the reports of his enemies,&rdquo; said Beauclerc.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not usually form my judgment,&rdquo; replied the general, &ldquo;from reports
      either of friends or enemies; I have not the honour of knowing any of Lord
      Beltravers&rsquo; enemies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enemies of Lord Beltravers!&rdquo; exclaimed Lady Davenant. &ldquo;What right as he
      to enemies as if he were a great man?&mdash;a person of whom nobody ever
      heard, setting up to have enemies! But now-a-days, these candidates for
      fame, these would-be celebrated, set up their enemies as they would their
      equipages, on credit&mdash;then, by an easy process of logic, make out the
      syllogism thus:&mdash;Every great man has enemies, therefore, every man
      who has enemies must be great&mdash;hey, Beauclerc?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beauclerc vouchsafed only a faint, absent smile, and, turning to his
      guardian, asked&mdash;&ldquo;Since Lord Beltravers was not to be allowed the
      honours of enemies, or the benefit of pleading prejudice, on what <i>did</i>
      the general form his judgment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From his own words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay judgment, my dear general,&rdquo; cried Beauclerc; &ldquo;words repeated! by
      whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Repeated by no one&mdash;heard from himself, by myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yourself! I was not aware you had ever met;&mdash;when? where?&rdquo; Beauclerc
      started forward on his chair, and listened eagerly for the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pity!&rdquo; said Lady Davenant, speaking to herself,&mdash;&ldquo;pity! that &lsquo;with
      such quick affections kindling into flame,&rsquo; they should burn to waste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When, where?&rdquo; repeated Beauclerc, with his eyes fixed on his guardian,
      and his soul in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soberly and slowly his guardian answered, and categorically,&mdash;&ldquo;When
      did I meet Lord Beltravers? A short time before his father&rsquo;s death.&mdash;Where?
      At Lady Grace Bland&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Lady Grace Bland&rsquo;s!&mdash;where he could not possibly appear to
      advantage! Well, go on, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment&mdash;pardon me, Beauclerc; I have curiosity as well as
      yourself. May I ask why Lord Beltravers could not possibly have appeared
      to advantage at Lady Grace Bland&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I know he cannot endure her; I have heard him, speaking of her,
      quote what Johnson or somebody says of Clariss&mdash;&lsquo;a prating,
      preaching, frail creature.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said the general, &ldquo;he said this of his own aunt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt! You cannot mean that Lady Grace is his aunt?&rdquo; cried Beauclerc.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is his mother&rsquo;s sister,&rdquo; replied the general, &ldquo;and therefore is, I
      conceive, his aunt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; cried Beauclerc; &ldquo;people must tell the truth sometimes, even
      of their own relations; they must know it best, and therefore I conclude
      that what Beltravers said of Lady Grace is true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo! well jumped to a conclusion, Granville, as usual,&rdquo; said Lady
      Davenant, &ldquo;But go on, general, tell us what you have heard from this
      precious lord; can you have better than what Beauclerc, his own witness,
      gives in evidence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better I think, and in the same line,&rdquo; said the general: &ldquo;his lordship
      has the merit of consistency. At table, servants of course present, and
      myself a stranger, I heard Lord Beltravers begin by cursing England and
      all that inhabit it. &lsquo;But your country!&rsquo; remonstrated his aunt. He abjured
      England; he had no country, he said, no liberal man ever has; he had no
      relations&mdash;what nature gave him without his consent he had a right to
      disclaim, I think he argued. But I can swear to these words, with which he
      concluded&mdash;&lsquo;My father is an idiot, my mother a brute, and my sister
      may go to the devil her own way.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such bad taste!&rdquo; said the aid-de-camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Davenant smiled at the unspeakable astonishment in Helen&rsquo;s face.
      &ldquo;When you have lived one season in the world, my dear child, this power of
      surprise will be worn out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But even to those who have seen the world,&rdquo; said the aide-de-camp, who
      had seen the world, &ldquo;as it strikes me, really it is such extraordinary bad
      taste!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such ordinary bad taste! as it strikes me,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant; &ldquo;base
      imitation, and imitation is always a confession of poverty, a want of
      original genius. But then there are degrees among the race of imitators.
      Some choose their originals well, some come near them tolerably; but here,
      all seems equally bad, clumsy, Birmingham counterfeit; don&rsquo;t you think so,
      Beauclerc? a counterfeit that falls and makes no noise. There is the worst
      of it for your protégé, whose great ambition I am sure it is to make a
      noise in the world. However, I may spare my remonstrances, for I am quite
      aware that you would never let drop a friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, never!&rdquo; cried Beauclerc.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, my dear Granville, do not take up this man, this Lord Beltravers,
      for, depend upon it, he will never do. If he had made a bold stroke for a
      reputation, like a great original, and sported some deed without a name,
      to work upon the wonder-loving imagination of the credulous English
      public, one might have thought something of him. But this cowardly,
      negative sin, <i>not</i> honouring his father and mother! so commonplace,
      too, neutral tint&mdash;no effect. Quite a failure, one cannot even stare,
      and you know, Granville, the object of all these strange speeches is
      merely to make fools stare. To be the wonder of the London world for a
      single day, is the great ambition of these ephemeral fame-hunters &lsquo;insects
      that shine, buzz, and fly-blow in the setting sun.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beauclerc pushed away his tea-cup half across the table, exclaiming, &ldquo;How
      unjust! to class him among a tribe he detests and despises as much as you
      can, Lady Davenant. And all for that one unfortunate speech&mdash;Not
      quite fair, general, not quite philosophical, Lady Davenant, to decide on
      a man&rsquo;s character from the specimen of a single speech: this is like
      judging of a house from the sample of a single brick. All this time I know
      how Beltravers came to make that speech&mdash;I know how it was, as well
      as if I had been present&mdash;better!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better!&rdquo; cried Lady Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen may laugh,&rdquo; resumed Beauclerc, &ldquo;but I seriously
      maintain&mdash;better!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How better than the general, who was present, and heard and saw the
      whole?&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, better, for he saw only effects, and I know causes; and I appeal to
      Lady Davenant,&mdash;from Lady Davenant sarcastic to Lady Davenant
      philosophic I appeal&mdash;may not the man who discovers causes, say he
      knows more than he who merely sees effects?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may say he knows more, at all events,&rdquo; replied Lady Davenant; &ldquo;but now
      for the discovery of causes, metaphysical sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have done,&rdquo; cried the general, turning to leave the breakfast-room;
      &ldquo;when Beauclerc goes to metaphysics I give it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, do not give it up, my dear general,&rdquo; cried Lady Cecilia; &ldquo;do not
      stir till we have heard what will come next, for I am sure it will be
      something delightfully absurd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beauclerc bowed, and feared he should not justify her ladyship&rsquo;s good
      opinion, for he had nothing delightfully absurd to say, adding that the
      cause of his friend&rsquo;s appearing like a brute was, that he feared to be a
      hypocrite among hypocrites.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Beltravers was in company with a set who were striving, with all
      their might of dissimulation, to appear better than they are, and he, as
      he always does, strove to make himself appear worse than he really is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unnecessary, I should think,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible, I should think,&rdquo; said the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible I know it is to change your opinion, general, of any one,&rdquo;
       said Beauclerc.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my own part, I am glad of that,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia, rising; &ldquo;and I
      advise you, Granville, to rest content with the general&rsquo;s opinion of
      yourself, and say no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Beauclerc; &ldquo;one cannot be content to think only of one&rsquo;s-self
      always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say no more, say no more,&rdquo; repeated Lady Cecilia, smiling as she looked
      back from the door, where she had stopped the general. &ldquo;For my sake say no
      more, I entreat, I do dislike to hear so much said about anything or
      anybody. What sort of a road is it to Old Forest?&rdquo; continued she; &ldquo;why
      should not we ladies go with you, my dear Clarendon, to enliven the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clarendon&rsquo;s countenance brightened at this proposal. The road was
      certainly beautiful, he said, by the banks of the Thames. Lady Cecilia and
      the general left the room, but Beauclerc remained sitting at the
      breakfast-table, apparently intently occupied in forming a tripod of three
      tea-spoons; Lady Davenant opposite to him, looking at him earnestly,
      &ldquo;Granville!&rdquo; said she. He started, &ldquo;Granville! set my mind at ease by one
      word, tell me the <i>mot d&rsquo;énigme</i> of this sudden friendship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not what you suppose,&rdquo; said he steadily, yet colouring deeply. &ldquo;The fact
      is, that Beltravers and I were school-fellows; a generous little fellow he
      was as ever was born; he got me out of a sad scrape once at his own
      expense, and I can never forget it. We had never met since we left Eton,
      till about three weeks ago in town, when I found him in great
      difficulties, persecuted too, by a party&mdash;I could not turn my back on
      him&mdash;I would rather be shot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No immediate necessity for being shot, my dear Granville, I hope,&rdquo; said
      Lady Davenant. &ldquo;But if this be indeed <i>all</i>, I will never say another
      word against your Lord Beltravers; I will leave it to you to find out his
      character, or to time to show it. I shall be quite satisfied that you
      throw away your money, if it be only money that is in the question; be
      this Lord Beltravers what he may. Let him say, &lsquo;or let them do, it is all
      one to me,&rsquo; provided that he does not marry you to his sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has not a thought of it,&rdquo; cried Beauclerc; &ldquo;and if he had, do you
      conceive, Lady Davenant, that any man on earth could dispose of me in
      marriage, at his pleasure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be assured not; my own will, my own heart alone, must decide that
      matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The horses are at the door!&rdquo; cried Cecilia, as she entered; but &ldquo;where&rsquo;s
      Helen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen had made her escape out of the room when Lady Davenant had
      pronounced the words, &ldquo;Set my mind at rest, Granville,&rdquo; as she felt it
      must then be embarrassing to him to speak, and to herself to hear. Her
      retreat, had not, however, been effected with considerable loss, she had
      been compelled to leave a large piece of the crape-trimming of her gown
      under the foot of Lady Davenant&rsquo;s inexorable chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is something that belongs to Miss Stanley, if I mistake not,&rdquo; said
      the general, who first spied the fragment. The aid-de-camp stooped for it&mdash;Lady
      Cecilia pitied it&mdash;Lady Davenant pronounced it to be Helen&rsquo;s own
      fault&mdash;Beauclerc understood how it happened, and said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Helen,&rdquo; cried Lady Cecilia, as she re-appeared,&mdash;&ldquo;but, Helen,
      are you not coming with us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen had intended to have gone in the pony-carriage with Lady Davenant,
      but her ladyship now declared that she had business to do at home; it was
      settled therefore that Helen was to be of the riding party, and that party
      consisted of Lady Cecilia and the general, Beauclerc and herself.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was a delightful day, sun shining, not too hot, air balmy, birds
      singing, all nature gay; and the happy influence was quickly felt by the
      riding party. Unpleasant thoughts of the past or future, if any such had
      been, were now lost in present enjoyment. The general, twice a man on
      horseback, as he always felt himself, managed his own and Helen&rsquo;s horse to
      admiration, and Cecilia, riding on with Beauclerc, was well pleased to
      hear his first observation, that he had been quite wrong last night, in
      not acknowledging that Miss Stanley was beautiful. &ldquo;People look so
      different by daylight and by candlelight,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;and so different when
      one does not know them at all, and when one begins to know something of
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what can you know yet of Helen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One forms some idea of character from trifles light as air. How
      delightful this day is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now you really allow she may be called beautiful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is, with some expression of mind, heart, soul, which is what I
      look for in general,&rdquo; said Beauclerc.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In general, what can you mean by in general?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in particular; in particular cases I might think&mdash;I&mdash;I
      might feel&mdash;otherwise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In particular, then, do you like fools that have no mind, heart, or soul,
      Granville?&mdash;Answer me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that horse is too spirited for a lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for me,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia; &ldquo;but do not think you shall get off so;
      what did you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My meaning lies too deep for the present occasion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the present company&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beauclerc half smiled and answered&mdash;&ldquo;You know you used to tell me
      that you hated long discussions on words and nice distinctions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, but let me have the nice distinction now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Between love and friendship, then, there is a vast difference in what one
      wishes for in a woman&rsquo;s face; there are, &lsquo;faces which pale passion
      loves.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the right, turn,&rdquo; the general&rsquo;s voice far behind was heard to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the right they turned, into a glade of the park, which opened to a
      favourite view of the general&rsquo;s, to which Cecilia knew that all attention
      must be paid. He came up, and they proceeded through a wood which had been
      planted by his father, and which seemed destined to stand for ever secure
      from sacrilegious axe. The road led them next into a village, one of the
      prettiest of that sort of scattered English villages, where each
      habitation seems to have been suited to the fancy as well as to the
      convenience of each proprietor; giving an idea at once of comfort and
      liberty, such as can be seen only in England. Happy England, how blest,
      would she but know her bliss!
    </p>
    <p>
      This village was inhabited by the general&rsquo;s tenants. His countenance
      brightened and expanded, as did theirs, whenever he came amongst them; he
      saw them happy, and they knew that they owed their happiness in just
      proportion to their landlord and themselves; therefore there was a
      comfortable mixture in their feelings of gratitude and self-respect. Some
      old people who were sitting on the stone benches, sunning themselves at
      their doors, rose as he passed, cap in hand, with cordial greeting. The
      oldest man, the father of the village, forgot his crutch as he came
      forward to see his landlord&rsquo;s bride, and to give him joy. At every house
      where they stopped, out came husband, wife, and children, even &ldquo;wee
      toddling things;&rdquo; one of these, while the general was speaking to its
      mother, made its way frightfully close to his horse&rsquo;s heels: Helen saw it,
      and called to the mother. The general, turning and leaning back on his
      horse, said to the bold little urchin as the mother snatched him up, &ldquo;My
      boy, as long as you live never again go behind a horse&rsquo;s heels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And remember, it was general Clarendon gave you this advice,&rdquo; added
      Beauclerc, and turning to Lady Cecilia&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Et souvenez vous que
      c&rsquo;est Maréchal Turenne qui vous l&rsquo;a dit</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the general searched for that English memento, six-pence, Lady
      Cecilia repeated, &ldquo;Marshal Turenne! I do not understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if you recollect,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say I know, but I don&rsquo;t remember,&rdquo; said Cecilia. &ldquo;It was only,&rdquo;
       said Helen, &ldquo;that the same thing had happened to Marshal Turenne, that he
      gave the same advice to a little child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia said she owed Beauclerc an acknowledgment down to her
      saddle-bow, for the compliment to her general, and a bow at least as low
      to Helen, for making her comprehend it; and, having paid both debts with
      graceful promptitude, she observed, in an aside to Beauclerc, that she
      quite agreed with him, that &ldquo;In friendship it was good not to have to do
      with fools.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is always permitted,&rdquo; continued Cecilia, &ldquo;to woman to use her
      intellects so far as to comprehend what man says; her knowledge, of
      whatever sort, never comes amiss when it serves only to illustrate what is
      said by one of the lords of the creation. Let us note this, my dear Helen,
      as a general maxim, for future use, and pray, since you have so good a
      memory, remember to tell mamma, who says I never generalise, that this
      morning I have actually made and established a philosophical maxim, one
      that may be of some use too, which cannot be said of all reflections,
      general or particular.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They rode on through a lane bright and fragrant with primroses and
      violets; gradually winding, this lane opened at last upon the beautiful
      banks of the Thames, whose &ldquo;silver bosom&rdquo; appeared at once before them in
      the bright sunshine, silent, flowing on, seeming, as Beauclerc said, as if
      it would for ever flow on unaltered in full, broad, placid dignity.
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he exclaimed, as they paused to contemplate the view, &ldquo;the throng
      of commerce, the ponderous barge, the black steam-boat, the hum and din of
      business, never have violated the mighty current. No lofty bridge
      insultingly over-arches it, no stone-built wharf confines it; nothing but
      its own banks, coeval with itself and like itself, uncontaminated by the
      petty uses of mankind!&mdash;they spread into large parks, or are hung
      with thick woods, as nature wills. No citizen&rsquo;s box, no chimera villa
      destroys the idea of repose; but nature, uninterrupted, carries on her own
      operations in field, and flood, and tree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general, less poetically inclined, would name to Helen all the fine
      places within view&mdash;&ldquo;Residences,&rdquo; as he practically remarked, &ldquo;such
      as cannot be seen in any country in the world but England; and not only
      fine places such as these, but from the cottage to the palace&mdash;&lsquo;the
      homes of Old England&rsquo; are the best homes upon earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The most candid and sensible of all modern French travellers,&rdquo; said
      Beauclerc, &ldquo;was particularly struck with the superiority of our English
      country residences, and the comfort of our homes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean M. de Staël?&rdquo; said the general; &ldquo;true English sense in that
      book, I allow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the general and Beauclerc did agree in opinion about a book, which
      was not a circumstance of frequent occurrence, they were mutually
      delighted; one always feeling the value of the other&rsquo;s practical sense,
      and the other then acknowledging that literature is good for something.
      Beauclerc in the fulness of his heart, and abundance of his words, began
      to expatiate on M. de Staël&rsquo;s merits, in having better than any foreigner
      understood the actual workings and balances of the British constitution,
      that constitution so much talked of abroad, and so little understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So little understood any where,&rdquo; said the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reasonably as Beauclerc now spoke, Helen formed a new idea of his
      capacity, and began to think more respectfully even of his common sense,
      than when she had heard him in the Beltravers cause. He spoke of the
      causes of England&rsquo;s prosperity, the means by which she maintains her
      superiority among nations&mdash;her equal laws and their just
      administration. He observed, that the hope which every man born in
      England, even in the lowest station, may have of rising by his own merits
      to the highest eminence, forms the great spring of industry and talent. He
      agreed with the intelligent foreigner&rsquo;s observation, that the aristocracy
      of talent is superior in England to the aristocracy of birth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general seemed to demur at the word superior, drew himself up, but
      said nothing in contradiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Industry, and wealth, and education, and fashion, all emulous, act in
      England beneficially on each other,&rdquo; continued Beauclerc.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general sat at ease again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And above all,&rdquo; pursued Beauclerc,&mdash;&ldquo;above all, education and the
      diffusion of knowledge&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knowledge&mdash;yes, but take care of what kind,&rdquo; said his guardian. &ldquo;All
      kinds are good,&rdquo; said Beauclerc.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, only such as are safe,&rdquo; said the general. The march of intellect was
      not a favourite march with him, unless the step were perfectly kept, and
      all in good time.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now, on passing a projecting bend in the wood, they came within sight
      of a place in melancholy contrast to all they had just admired. A park of
      considerable extent, absolutely bereft of trees, except a few ragged firs
      on each side of a large dilapidated mansion, on the summit of a bleak
      hill: it seemed as if a great wood had once been there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Forest!&rdquo; exclaimed the general; &ldquo;Old Forest, now no more! Many a
      happy hour, when I was a boy, have I spent shooting in those woods,&rdquo; and
      he pointed to where innumerable stumps of trees, far as the eye could
      reach, marked where the forest had once stood: some of the white circles
      on the ground showed the magnificent size of those newly felled. Beauclerc
      was quite silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general led the way on to the great gate of entrance: the porter&rsquo;s
      lodge was in ruins.
    </p>
    <p>
      A huge rusty padlock hung upon one of the gates, which had been dragged
      half open, but, the hinge having sunk, there it stuck&mdash;the gate could
      not be opened further. The other could not be stirred without imminent
      hazard of bringing down the pier on which it hung, and which was so crazy,
      the groom said, &ldquo;he was afraid, if he shook it never so little, all would
      come down together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let it alone,&rdquo; said the general, in the tone of one resolved to be
      patient; &ldquo;there is room enough for us to get in one by one&mdash;Miss
      Stanley, do not be in a hurry, if you please; follow me quietly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In they filed. The avenue, overgrown with grass, would have been difficult
      to find, but for deep old cart-ruts which still marked the way. But soon,
      fallen trees, and lopped branches, dragged many a rood and then left
      there, made it difficult to pass. And there lay exposed the white bodies
      of many a noble tree, some wholly, some half, stripped of their bark, some
      green in decay, left to the weather&mdash;and every here and there little
      smoking pyramids of burning charcoal.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they approached the house&mdash;&ldquo;How changed,&rdquo; said the general, &ldquo;from
      that once cheerful hospitable mansion!&rdquo;&mdash;It was a melancholy example
      of a deserted home: the plaster dropping off, the cut stone green, the
      windows broken, the shutters half shut, the way to the hall-door steps
      blocked up. They were forced to go round through the yards. Coach-houses
      and stables, grand ranges, now all dilapidated. Only one yelping cur in
      the great kennel. The back-door being ajar, the general pushed it open,
      and they went in, and on to the great kitchen, where they found in the
      midst of wood smoke one little old woman, whom they nearly scared out of
      her remaining senses. She stood and stared. Beauclerc stepped towards her
      to explain; but she was deaf: he raised his voice&mdash;in vain. She was
      made to comprehend by the general, whose voice, known in former times,
      reached her heart&mdash;&ldquo;that they only came to see the place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See the place! ah! a sad sight to see.&rdquo; Her eyes reverted to Beauclerc,
      and, conceiving that he was the young lord himself, she waxed pale, and
      her head shook fearfully; but, when relieved from this mistake, she went
      forward to show them over the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they proceeded up the great staircase, she confided to her friend, the
      general, that she was glad it was not the young lord, for she was told he
      was a fiery man, and she dreaded his coming unawares.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia asked if she did not know him?
    </p>
    <p>
      No, she had never seen him since he was a little fellow: &ldquo;he has been
      always roaming about, like the rest, in foreign parts, and has never set
      foot in the place since he came to man&rsquo;s estate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the general passed a window on the landing-place, he looked out.&mdash;&ldquo;You
      are missing the great elm, Sir. Ah! I remember you here, a boy; you was
      always good. It was the young lord ordered specially the cutting of that,
      which I could not stomach; the last of the real old trees! Well, well! I&rsquo;m
      old and foolish&mdash;I&rsquo;m old and foolish, and I should not talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But still she talked on, and as this seemed her only comfort, they would
      not check her garrulity. In the hope that they were come to take the
      house, she now bustled as well as she could, to show all to the best
      advantage, but bad was the best now, as she sorrowfully said. She was very
      unwilling that the gentlemen should go up to inspect the roof. They went,
      however; and the general saw and estimated, and Beauclerc saw and hoped.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general, recollecting the geography of the house, observed that she
      had not shown them what used to be the picture-gallery, which looked out
      on the terrace; he desired to see it. She reluctantly obeyed; and, after
      trying sundry impossible keys, repeating all the while that her heart was
      broke, that she wished it had pleased God never to give her a heart,
      unlock the door she could not in her trepidation. Beauclerc gently took
      the keys from her, and looked so compassionately upon her, that she
      God-blessed him, and thought it a pity her young lord was not like him;
      and while he dealt with the lock, Lady Cecilia, saying they would trouble
      her no further, slipped into her hand what she thought would be some
      comfort. The poor old creature thanked her ladyship, but said gold could
      be of no use to her now in life; she should soon let the parish bury her,
      and be no cost to the young lord. She could forgive many things, she said,
      but she could never forgive him for parting with the old pictures. She
      turned away as the gallery-door opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      One only old daub of a grandmother was there; all the rest had been sold,
      and their vacant places remained discoloured on the walls. There were two
      or three dismembered old chairs, the richly dight windows broken, the
      floor rat-eaten. The general stood and looked, and did not sigh, but
      absolutely groaned. They went to the shattered glass door, which looked
      out upon the terrace&mdash;that terrace which had cost thousands of pounds
      to raise, and he called Cecilia to show her the place where the youngsters
      used to play, and to point out some of his favourite haunts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is most melancholy to see a family-place so gone to ruin,&rdquo; said
      Beauclerc; &ldquo;if it strikes us so much, what must it be to the son of this
      family, to come back to the house of his ancestors, and find it thus
      desolate! Poor Beltravers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The expression of the general&rsquo;s eye changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure you must pity him, my dear general,&rdquo; continued Beauclerc.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might, had he done any thing to prevent, or had he done less to hasten,
      this ruin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How? he should not have cut down the trees, do you mean?&mdash;but it was
      to pay his father&rsquo;s debts&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And his own,&rdquo; said the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told me his father&rsquo;s, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I tell you his own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even so,&rdquo; said Beauclerc, &ldquo;debts are not crimes for which we ought to
      shut the gates of mercy on our fellow-creatures&mdash;and so young a man
      as Beltravers, left to himself, without a home, his family abroad, no
      parent, no friend&mdash;no guardian friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is it you would do, Beauclerc?&rdquo; said the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you must wish to be done,&rdquo; said Beauclerc. &ldquo;Repair this ruin,
      restore this once hospitable mansion, and put it in the power of the son
      to be what his ancestors have been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how&mdash;my dear Beauclerc? Tell me plainly&mdash;how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plainly, I would lend him money enough to make this house fit to live
      in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he would never repay you, and would never live in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would, sir&mdash;he promised me he would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Promised you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I promised him that I would lend him the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Promised! Beauclerc? Without your guardian&rsquo;s knowledge? Pray, how much&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound me, if I remember the words. The sense was, what would do the
      business; what would make the house fit for him and his sisters to live
      in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten thousand!&mdash;fifteen thousand would not do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir. You know what will be necessary better than I do. A few
      thousands more or less, what signifies, provided a friend be well served.
      The superfluous money accumulated during my long minority cannot be better
      employed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that I have been saving for you with such care from the time your
      father died!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear guardian, my dear friend, do not think me ungrateful; but the
      fact is,&mdash;in short, my happiness does not depend, never can depend,
      upon money; as my friend, therefore, I beseech you to consider my moneyed
      interest less, and my happiness more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beauclerc, you do not know what your happiness is. One hour you tell me
      it is one thing, the next another. What is become of the plan for the new
      house you wanted to build for yourself? I must have common sense for you,
      Beauclerc, as you have none for yourself. I shall not give you this money
      for Lord Beltravers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget sir, that I told you I had promised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget, Beauclerc, that I told you that such a promise, vague and
      absurd in itself, made without your guardian&rsquo;s concurrence or consent, is
      absolutely null and void.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Null and void in law, perhaps it may be,&rdquo; cried Beauclerc; &ldquo;but for that
      very reason, in honour, the stronger the more binding, and I am speaking
      to a man of honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To one who can take care of his own honour,&rdquo; said the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And of mine, I trust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do well to trust it, as your father did, to me: it shall not be
      implicated&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When once I am of age,&rdquo; interrupted Beauclerc.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will do as you please,&rdquo; said the general. &ldquo;In the mean time I shall
      do my duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sir, I only ask you to let me <i>lend</i> this money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lend&mdash;nonsense! lend to a man who cannot give any security.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Security!&rdquo; said Beauclerc, with a look of unutterable contempt. &ldquo;When a
      friend is in distress, to talk to him like an attorney, of security! Do,
      pray, sir, spare me that. I would rather give the money at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I make no doubt of it; then at once I say No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir! and why do you say no?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I think it my duty, and nothing I have heard has at all shaken my
      opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Opinion! and so I am to be put down by opinion, without any reason!&rdquo;
       cried Beauclerc. Then trying to command his temper, &ldquo;But tell me, my dear
      general, why I cannot have this cursed money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, my dear Beauclerc, I am your guardian, and can say <i>no</i>,
      and can adhere to a refusal as firmly as any man living, when it is
      necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and when it is unnecessary. General Clarendon, according to your own
      estimate, fifteen thousand pounds is the utmost sum requisite to put this
      house in a habitable state&mdash;by that sum I abide!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Abide!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I require it, to keep my promise to Beltraver&rsquo;s, and have it I
      MUST.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From some one else then, for have it I WILL.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest Clarendon,&rdquo; whispered Lady Cecilia, &ldquo;let him have it, since he
      has promised&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without seeming to hear her whisper, without a muscle of his countenance
      altering, General Clarendon repeated, &ldquo;Not from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From some one else then&mdash;I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not while I have power to prevent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Power! power! power! Yes, that is what you love, above all things and all
      persons, and I tell you plainly, General Clarendon,&rdquo; pursued Beauclerc,
      too angry to heed or see Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s remonstrating looks, &ldquo;at once I
      tell you that you have not the power. You had it. It is past and gone. The
      power of affection you had, if not of reason; but force, General
      Clarendon, despotism, can never govern me. I submit to no man&rsquo;s mere will,
      much less to any man&rsquo;s sheer obstinacy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the word obstinacy, the general&rsquo;s face, which was before rigid, grew
      hard as iron. Beauclerc walked up and down the room with great strides,
      and as he strode he went on talking to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be kept from the use of my own money, treated like a child&mdash;an
      idiot&mdash;at my time of life! Not considered at years of discretion,
      when other men of the meanest capacity, by the law of the land, can do
      what they please with their own property! By heavens!&mdash;that will of
      my father&rsquo;s&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should be respected, my dear Granville, since it was your father&rsquo;s will,&rdquo;
       said Lady Cecilia, joining him as he walked. &ldquo;And respect&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       He stopped short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Lady Cecilia, for your sake&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he tried to restrain
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Till this moment never did I say one disrespectful word to General
      Clarendon. I always considered him as the representative of my father; and
      when most galled I have borne the chains in which it was my father&rsquo;s
      pleasure to leave me. Few men of my age would have so submitted to a
      guardian not many years older than himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and indeed that should be considered,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia, turning to
      the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have always considered General Clarendon more as my friend than my
      guardian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have found him so, I had hoped,&rdquo; said the general, relaxing in tone
      but not in looks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never treated you, sir, as some wards treat their guardians. I
      have dealt openly, as man of honour to man of honour, gentleman to
      gentleman, friend to friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Acknowledged, and felt by me, Beauclerc.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then now, my dear Clarendon, grant the only request of any consequence I
      ever made you&mdash;say yes.&rdquo; Beauclerc trembled with impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the general, &ldquo;I have said it&mdash;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gallery rung with the sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; repeated Beauclerc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each walked separately up and down the room, speaking without listening to
      what the other said. Helen heard an offer from Beauclerc, to which she
      extremely wished that the general had listened. But he was deaf with
      determination not to yield to any thing Beauclerc could say further: the
      noise of passion in their ears was too great for either of them to hear
      the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly turning, Beauclerc exclaimed,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Borne with me, do you say? &lsquo;Tis I that have to bear&mdash;and by
      heavens!&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;more than I can&mdash;than I will&mdash;bear. Before
      to-morrow&rsquo;s sun goes down I will have the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From any money-lending Jew&mdash;usurer&mdash;extortioner&mdash;cheat&mdash;rascal&mdash;whatever
      he be. You drive me to it&mdash;you&mdash;you my friend&mdash;you, with
      whom I have dealt so openly; and to the last it shall be open. To no vile
      indirections will I stoop. I tell you, my guardian, that if you deny me my
      own, I will have what I want from the Jews.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easily,&rdquo; said his guardian. &ldquo;But first, recollect that a clause in your
      father&rsquo;s will, in such case, sends his estates to your cousin Venables.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To my cousin Venables let them go&mdash;all&mdash;all; if such be your
      pleasure, sir, be it so. The lowest man on earth that has feeling keeps
      his promise. The slave has a right to his word! Ruin me if you will, and
      as soon as you please; disgrace me you cannot; bend my spirit you cannot;
      ruin in any shape I will meet, rather than submit to such a guardian, such
      a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tyrant he was on the point of saying, but Lady Cecilia stopped that word
      by suddenly seizing upon his arm: forcibly she carried him off, saying
      &ldquo;Come out with me on the terrace, Granville, and recover your senses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My senses! I have never lost them; never was cooler in my life,&rdquo; said he,
      kicking open the glass door upon its first resistance, and shattering its
      remaining panes to fragments. Unnoticing, not hearing the crash, the
      general stood leaning his elbow on the mantel-piece, and covering his eyes
      with his hand. Helen remained near him, scarce breathing loud enough to be
      heard; he did not know she was there, and he repeated aloud, in an accent
      of deep feeling, &ldquo;Tyrant! from Beauclerc!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sigh from Helen made him aware of her presence, and, as he removed his
      hand from his eyes, she saw his look was more in sorrow than in anger: she
      said softly, &ldquo;Mr. Beauclerc was wrong, very wrong, but he was in a
      passion, he did not know what he meant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for a few moments. &ldquo;You are right, I believe,&rdquo; said the
      general, &ldquo;it was heat of anger&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To which the best are subject,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;and the best and kindest
      most easily forgive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Beauclerc said some things which were&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unpardonable&mdash;only forget them; let all be forgotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the general, &ldquo;all but my determination; that, observe, is
      fixed. My mind, Miss Stanley, is made up, and, once made up, it is not to
      be changed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am certain of that,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;but I am not clear that your mind is
      made up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general looked at her with astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your refusal is not irrevocable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not know me, Miss Stanley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better than I know myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, better, if you do yourself the injustice to think that you would not
      yield, if it were right to do so. At this very instant,&rdquo; pursued Helen,
      disregarding his increasing astonishment, &ldquo;you would yield if you could
      reasonably, honourably&mdash;would not you? If you could without injury to
      your ward&rsquo;s fortune or character, would you not? Surely it is for his good
      only that you are so resolute?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly!&rdquo; He waited with eyes fixed, bending forward, but with
      intensity of purpose in his calmness of attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was something which I heard Mr. Beauclerc say, which, I think,
      escaped your attention,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;When you spoke of the new house he
      intended to build for himself, which was to cost so much, he offered to
      give that up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never heard that offer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard him,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;I assure you: it was when you were both
      walking up and down the room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This may be so, I was angry <i>then</i>,&rdquo; said the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are not angry now,&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled, and in truth he desired nothing more than an honourable
      loophole&mdash;a safe way of coming off without injury to his ward&mdash;without
      hurting his own pride, or derogating from the dignity of guardian. Helen
      saw this, and, thanking him for his condescension, his kindness, in
      listening to her, she hastened as quickly as possible, lest the relenting
      moment might not be seized; and running out on the terrace, she saw
      Beauclerc, his head down upon his arms, leaning upon an old broken stone
      lion, and Lady Cecilia standing beside him, commiserating; and as she
      approached, she heard her persuading him to go to the general, and speak
      to him again, and say <i>so</i>&mdash;only say so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever it was, Helen did not stay to inquire, but told Cecilia, in as
      few words as she could, all that she had to say; and ended with &ldquo;Was I
      right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right, was not she, Granville?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beauclerc looked up&mdash;a gleam of hope and joy came across his face,
      and, with one grateful look to Helen, he darted forward. They followed,
      but could not keep pace with him; and when they reached the gallery, they
      found him appealing, as to a father, for pardon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you forgive, and will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive my not hearing you, not listening to you, as your father would?
      My dear Beauclerc, you were too hot, and I was too cold; and there is an
      end of it.&rdquo; This reconciliation was as quick, as warm, as the quarrel had
      been. And then explanations were made, as satisfactorily as they are when
      the parties are of good understanding, and depend on each other&rsquo;s truth,
      past, present, and future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauclerc, whose promise all relied on, and for reasons good, none more
      implicitly than the general, promised that he would ask for no more than
      just what would do to put this Old Forest house in habitable trim; he said
      he would give up the new house for himself, till as many thousands as he
      now lent, spent, or wasted&mdash;take which word you will&mdash;should be
      again accumulated from his income. It was merely a sacrifice of his own
      vanity, and perhaps a little of his own comfort, he said, to save a
      friend, a human being, from destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, let it rest so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was all settled, witness present&mdash;&ldquo;two angels to witness,&rdquo; as
      Beauclerc quoted from some old play.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now in high good-humour, up again to nonsense pitch, they all felt
      that delightful relief of spirits, of which friends, after perilous
      quarrel, are sensible in perfect reconciliation. They left this melancholy
      mansion now, with Beauclerc the happiest of the happy, in the generous
      hope that he should be the restorer of its ancient glories and comfort.
      The poor old woman was not forgotten as they passed, she courtesying,
      hoping, and fearing: Lady Cecilia whispered, and the deaf ear heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The roof will not fall&mdash;all will be well: and there is the man that
      will do it all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, my heart inclined to him from the first&mdash;at least from
      the minute I knew him not to be my young lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were to go home by water. The boat was in readiness, and, as
      Beauclerc carefully handed Helen into it, the general said:&mdash;&ldquo;Yes,
      you are right to take care of Miss Stanley, Beauclerc; she is a good
      friend in need, at least, as I have found this morning,&rdquo; added he, as he
      seated himself beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia was charming, and every thing was delightful, especially the
      cold chicken.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      No two people could be more unlike in their habits of mind than this
      guardian and ward. General Clarendon referred in all cases to old
      experience, and dreaded innovation; Beauclerc took for his motto, &ldquo;My mind
      leadeth me to new things.&rdquo; General Clarendon was what is commonly called a
      practical man; Granville Beauclerc was the flower of theorists. The
      general, fit for action, prompt and decided in all his judgments, was
      usually right and just in his conclusions&mdash;but if wrong, there was no
      setting him right; for he not only would not, but could not go back over
      the ground&mdash;he could not give in words any explanation of his process
      of reasoning&mdash;it was enough for him that it was right, and that it
      was <i>his</i>; while Beauclerc, who cared not for any man&rsquo;s opinion, was
      always so ingeniously wrong, and could show all the steps of his reasoning
      so plausibly, that it was a pity he should be quite out of the right road
      at last. The general hated metaphysics, because he considered them as
      taking a flight beyond the reach of discipline, as well as of common
      sense: he continually asked, of what use are they?&mdash;While Lady
      Davenant answered,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To invigorate and embellish the understanding. &lsquo;This turning the soul
      inward on itself concentrates its forces, and fits it for the strongest
      and boldest flights; and in such pursuits, whether we take or whether we
      lose the game, the chase is certainly of service.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Possibly, the general said; he would not dispute the point with Lady
      Davenant, but a losing chase, however invigorating, was one in which he
      never wished to engage: as to the rest, he altogether hated discussions,
      doubts, and questionings. He had &ldquo;made up his fagot of opinions,&rdquo; and
      would not let one be drawn out for examination, lest he should loosen the
      bundle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauclerc, on the contrary, had his dragged out and scattered about every
      day, and each particular stick was tried, and bent, and twisted, this way
      and that, and peeled, and cut, and hacked; and unless they proved sound to
      the very core, not a twig of them should ever go back into his bundle,
      which was to be the bundle of bundles, the best that ever was seen, when
      once tied so that it would hold together&mdash;of which there seemed
      little likelihood, as every knot slipped, and all fell to pieces at each
      pull.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was engaged in this analysis, he was, as his guardian thought, in
      great moral peril, for not a principle had he left to bless himself with;
      and, in any emergency, if any temptation should occur, what was to become
      of him? The general, who was very fond of him, but also strongly attached
      to his own undeviating rule of right, was upon one occasion about
      peremptorily to interpose, not only with remonstrances as a friend, but
      with authority as a guardian.
    </p>
    <p>
      This occurred when Beauclerc was with them at Florence, and when the
      general&rsquo;s love for Lady Cecilia, and intimacy with her mother, commenced.
      Lady Davenant being much interested for young Beauclerc, begged that the
      patient might be left to her, and that his guardian would refrain from
      interference. This was agreed to the more readily by the general, as his
      thoughts and feelings were then more agreeably engrossed, and Beauclerc
      found in Lady Davenant the very friend he wanted and wished for most
      ardently&mdash;one whose mind would not blench at any moral danger, would
      never shrink from truth in any shape, but, calm and self-possessed, would
      examine whether it were indeed truth, or only a phantom assuming her form.
      Besides, there was in Lady Davenant towards Beauclerc a sort of maternal
      solicitude and kindness, of which the effect was heightened by her
      dignified manner and pride of character. She, in the first place, listened
      to him patiently; she, who could talk, would listen: this was, as she
      said, her first merit in his estimation. To her he poured forth all those
      doubts, of which she was wise enough not to make crimes: she was sure of
      his honourable intentions, certain that there was no underhand motive, no
      bad passion, no concealed vice, or disposition to vice, beneath his
      boasted freedom from prejudice, to be justified or to be indulged by
      getting rid of the restraints of principle. Had there been any danger of
      this sort, which with young men who profess themselves <i>ultra-liberal</i>
      is usually the case, she would have joined in his guardian&rsquo;s
      apprehensions; but in fact Beauclerc, instead of being &ldquo;le philosophe sans
      le savoir,&rdquo; was &ldquo;le bon enfant sans le savoir;&rdquo; for, while he questioned
      the rule of right in all his principles, and while they were held in
      abeyance, his good habits, and good natural disposition held fast and
      stood him in stead; while Lady Davenant, by slow degrees, brought him to
      define his terms, and presently to see that he had been merely saying old
      things in new words, and that the systems which had dazzled him as
      novelties were old to older eyes; in short, that he was merely a
      resurrectionist of obsolete heresies, which had been gone over and over
      again at various long-past periods, and over and over again abandoned by
      the common sense of mankind: so that, after puzzling and wandering a weary
      way in the dark labyrinth he had most ingeniously made for himself, he saw
      light, followed it, and at length, making his way out, was surprised, and
      sorry perhaps to perceive that it was the common light of day.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is of great consequence to young enthusiastic tyros, like Beauclerc, to
      have safe friends to whom they can talk of their opinions privately,
      otherwise they will talk their ingenious nonsense publicly, and so they
      bind themselves, or are bound, to the stake, and live or die martyrs to
      their own follies.
    </p>
    <p>
      From these and all such dangers Lady Davenant protected him, and she took
      care that nobody hurt him in his defenceless state, before his shell was
      well formed and hardened. She was further of peculiar service in keeping
      all safe and smooth between the ward and guardian. All Beauclerc&rsquo;s romance
      the general would have called by the German word &ldquo;<i>Schwärmerey</i>,&rdquo;&mdash;not
      fudge&mdash;not humbug&mdash;literally &ldquo;sky-rocketing&rdquo;&mdash;visionary
      enthusiasm; and when it came to arguments, they might have turned to
      quarrels, but for Lady Davenant&rsquo;s superior influence, while Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s
      gentleness and gaiety usually succeeded in putting all serious dangerous
      thoughts to flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nature never having intended Lady Cecilia for a manoeuvrer, she was now
      perpetually on the point of betraying herself; and one day, when she was
      alone with Helen, she exclaimed, &ldquo;Never was any thing better managed than
      I managed this, my dear Helen! I am so glad I told you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       Recollecting herself just in time, she ended with, &ldquo;so glad I told you the
      truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes! thank you,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;My uncle used to say no one could be a
      good friend who does not tell the whole truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I deny,&rdquo; thought Cecilia. The twinge of conscience was felt but very
      slightly; not visible in any change of countenance, except by a quick
      twinkling motion of the eyelashes, not noticed by unsuspicious Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every thing now went on as happily as Cecilia could have desired; every
      morning they rode or booted to Old Forest to see what was doing. The roof
      was rather hastily taken off; Lady Cecilia hurried forward that measure,
      aware that it would prevent the possibility of any of the ladies of the
      family coming there for some time. Delay was all she wanted, and she would
      now, as she promised herself, leave the rest to time. She would never
      interfere further in word or look, especially when her mother might be by.
      One half of this promise she kept faithfully, the other she broke
      continually.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were plans to be made of all the alterations and improvements at Old
      Forest. Beauclerc applied to Lady Cecilia for her advice and assistance.
      Her advice she gave, but her assistance she ingeniously contrived to leave
      to Helen; for whenever Beauclerc brought to her a sketch or a plan of what
      was to be done, Lady Cecilia immediately gave it to Helen, repeating,
      &ldquo;Never drew a regular plan in my life, you know, my dear, you must do
      this;&rdquo; so that Helen&rsquo;s pencil and her patience were in constant
      requisition. Then came apologies from Beauclerc, and regrets at taking up
      her time, all which led to an intimacy that Lady Cecilia took care to keep
      up by frequent visits to Old Forest, so that Helen was necessarily joined
      in all his present pursuits.
    </p>
    <p>
      During one of these visits, they were looking over some old furniture
      which Lord Beltravers had commissioned Beauclerc to have disposed of at
      some neighbouring auction. There was one curiously carved oak arm-chair,
      belonging to &ldquo;the old old gentleman of all&rdquo; which the old woman
      particularly regretted should go. She had sewn it up in a carpet, and when
      it came out, Helen was struck with its likeness to a favourite chair of
      her uncle&rsquo;s; many painful recollections occurred to her, and tears came
      into her eyes. Ashamed of what appeared so like affectation, she turned
      away, that her tears might not be seen, and when Cecilia, following her,
      insisted on knowing what was the matter, she left Helen immediately to the
      old woman, and took the opportunity of telling Beauclerc all about Dean
      Stanley, and how Helen was an heiress and no heiress, and her having
      determined to give up all her fortune to pay her uncle&rsquo;s debts. There was
      a guardian, too, in the case, who would not consent; and, in short, a
      parallelism of circumstances, a similarity of generous temper, and all
      this she thought must interest Beauclerc&mdash;and so it did. But yet its
      being told to him would have gone against his nice notions of delicacy,
      and Helen would have been ruined in his opinion had he conceived that it
      had been revealed to him with her consent or connivance. She came back
      before Lady Cecilia had quite finished, and a few words which she heard,
      made her aware of the whole. The blush of astonishment&mdash;the glance of
      indignation&mdash;which she gave at Lady Cecilia, settled Beauclerc&rsquo;s
      opinion; and Cecilia was satisfied that she had done her friend good
      service against her will; and as to the means thought she&mdash;what
      signifies going back to consider when they succeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Collingwoods gladly availed themselves of Lady Cecilia Clarendon&rsquo;s
      kind invitation, as they were both most anxious to take leave of Helen
      Stanley before their departure. They were to sail very soon, so that their
      visit was but short; a few days of painful pleasure to Helen&mdash;a happy
      meeting, but enjoyed with the mournful sense that they were so soon to
      separate, and for so long a time; perhaps, for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Collingwood told Helen that if she still agreed to his conditions, he
      would arrange with Mr. James, the solicitor, that all the money left to
      her by her uncle should be appropriated to the payment of his debts.
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;pause and consider well, whether you can do without
      this money, which is still yours; you are, you know, not bound by any
      promise, and it is not yet too late to say you have altered your
      decision.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen smiled and said, &ldquo;You cannot be serious in saying this, I am sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Collingwood assured her that he was. Helen simply said that her
      determination was unalterable. He looked pleased yet his last words in
      taking leave of her were, &ldquo;Remember, my dear, that when you have given
      away your fortune, you cannot live as if you had it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Collingwoods departed; and, after a decent time had elapsed, or what
      she deemed a decent time, Lady Cecilia was anxious to ascertain what
      progress had been made; how relatively to each other, Lady Blanche
      Forrester and Helen stood in Beauclerc&rsquo;s opinion, or rather in his
      imagination. But this was not quite so easy a matter to determine as she
      had conceived it would be, judging from the frankness of Beauclerc&rsquo;s
      temper, and from the terms of familiarity on which they had lived while
      abroad. His confidence was not to be won, surprised, or forced. He was not
      only jealous of his free will, as most human beings are in love affairs,
      but, like all men of true feeling, he desired in these matters perfect
      mental privacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Pysche is awakened, it should be by Cupid alone. Beauclerc did not
      yet wish that she should be awakened. He admired, he enjoyed that repose;
      he was charmed by the perfect confiding simplicity of Helen&rsquo;s mind, so
      unlike what he had seen in others&mdash;so real. The hope of that pure
      friendship which dawned upon him he wished to prolong, and dreaded lest,
      by any doubt raised, all might be clouded and changed. Lady Cecilia was,
      however, convinced that, without knowing it, he was falling comfortably in
      love through friendship; a very easy convenient way.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Helen, had she too set out upon that easy convenient road of
      friendship? She did not think about the road, but she felt that it was
      very agreeable, and thought it was quite safe, as she went on so smoothly
      and easily. She could not consider Mr. Beauclerc as a new acquaintance,
      because she had heard so much about him. He was completely one of the
      family, so that she, as part of that family, could not treat him as a
      stranger. Her happiness, she was sensible, had much increased since his
      arrival; but so had everybody&rsquo;s. He gave a new spring, a new interest, to
      everything; added so much to the life of life; his sense and his nonsense
      were each of them good in their kind; and they were of various kinds, from
      the high sublime of metaphysics to the droll realities of life. But
      everybody blaming, praising, scolding, laughing <i>at</i>, or <i>with</i>
      him, he was necessary to all and with all, for some reason or other, a
      favourite.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the general was always as impatient as Lady Cecilia herself both of
      his hypercriticism and of his never-ending fancies, each of which
      Beauclerc purused with an eagerness and abandoned with a facility which
      sorely tried the general&rsquo;s equanimity. One day, after having ridden to Old
      Forest, General Clarendon returned chafed. He entered the library, talking
      to Cecilia, as Helen thought, about his horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No managing him! Curb him ever so little, and he is on his hind-legs
      directly. Give him his head, put the bridle on his neck, and he stands
      still; does not know which way he would go, or what he would do. The
      strangest fellow for a rational creature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now it was clear it was of Beauclerc that he spoke. &ldquo;So rash and yet so
      resolute,&rdquo; continued the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is that?&rdquo; said Lady Davenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know how, but so it is,&rdquo; said the general. &ldquo;As you know,&rdquo;
       appealing to Helen and to Lady Cecilia, &ldquo;he was ready to run me through
      till he had his own way about that confounded old house; and now there are
      all the workmen at a stand, because Mr. Beauclerc cannot decide what he
      will have done or undone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is my fault!&rdquo; cried Helen, with the guilty recollection of the
      last alteration not having been made yesterday in drawing the working
      plan, and she hastened to look for it directly; but when she found it, she
      saw to her dismay that Beauclerc had scribbled it all over with literary
      notes; it was in no state to meet the general&rsquo;s eye; she set about copying
      it as fast as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; pursued the general; &ldquo;forty alterations&mdash;shuffling about
      continually. Cannot a man be decided?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always with poor Beauclerc,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia, &ldquo;le mieux est l&rsquo;ennemi du
      bien.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear Cecilia, it is all his indolence; there he sat with a book in
      his hand all yesterday! with all his impetuosity, too indolent to stir in
      his own business,&rdquo; said the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His mind is too active sometimes to allow his body to stir,&rdquo; said Lady
      Davenant; &ldquo;and because he cannot move the universe, he will not stir his
      little finger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is very fond of paradoxes, and your ladyship is very fond of him,&rdquo;
       said the general; &ldquo;but indolent he is; and as to activity of mind, it is
      only in pursuit of his own fancies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your fancies and his differ,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he never fancies any thing useful,&rdquo; said the general. &ldquo;C&rsquo;est
      selon! c&rsquo;est selon!&rdquo; cried Lady Cecilia gaily; &ldquo;he thinks his fancies
      useful, and especially all he is doing at Old Forest; but I confess he
      tends most to the agreeable. Certainly he is a most agreeable creature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agreeable! satisfied to be called an agreeable man!&rdquo; cried the general
      indignantly; &ldquo;yes, he has no ambition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There I differ from you, general,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant; &ldquo;he has too much:
      have patience with him; he is long-sighted in his visions of glory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Visions indeed!&rdquo; said the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those who are really ambitious,&rdquo; continued Lady Davenant, &ldquo;must think
      before they act. &lsquo;What shall I do to be for ever known?&rsquo; is a question
      which deserves at least a little more thought than those which most young
      men ask themselves, which commonly are, &lsquo;What shall I do to be known
      to-morrow&mdash;on the Turf or at Brook&rsquo;s&mdash;or in Doctors&rsquo; Commons&mdash;or
      at some exclusive party at charming Lady Nobody&rsquo;s?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you do for the plan for these workmen in the mean time, my dear
      Clarendon?&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia, afraid that some long discussion would
      ensue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here it is!&rdquo; said Helen, who had managed to get it ready while they were
      talking. She gave it to the general, who thanked her, and was off
      directly. Cecilia then came to divert herself with looking at Beauclerc&rsquo;s
      scribbled plan, and she read the notes aloud for her mother&rsquo;s amusement.
      It was a sketch of a dramatical, metaphysical, entertainment, of which
      half a dozen proposed titles had been scratched out, and there was finally
      left &lsquo;Tarquin the Optimist, or the Temple of Destiny.&rsquo; It was from an old
      story begun by Laurentius Valla, and continued by Leibnitz;&mdash;she
      read,
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;Act I. Scene 1. Sextus Tarquin goes to consult the Oracle, who
      foretells the crime he is to commit.&lsquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; cried Lady Cecilia, &ldquo;come measures of old and new front of Old
      Forest house, wings included.&rdquo;&mdash;Now he goes on with his play.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;&lsquo;Tarquin&rsquo;s complaint to Jupiter of the Oracle&mdash;Modern
      Predestination compared to Ancient Destiny.&lsquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And here,&rdquo; continued Cecilia, &ldquo;come prices of Norway deal and a great
      blot, and then we have <i>&lsquo;Jupiter&rsquo;s answer that Sextus may avoid his doom
      if he pleases, by staying away from Rome; but he does not please to do so,
      because he must then</i> <i>renounce the crown. Good speech here on
      vanity, and inconsistency of human wishes.&lsquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Kitchen 23 ft. by 21. Query with hobs?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot conceive, my dear Helen,&rdquo; continued Lady Cecilia, &ldquo;how you could
      make the drawing out through all this,&rdquo; and she continued to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;&lsquo;Scene 3rd.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;&lsquo;High Priest of Delphi asks Jupiter why he did not give Sextus a
      better WILL?&mdash;why not MAKE him choose to give up the crown, rather
      than commit the crime? Jupiter refuses to answer, and sends the High
      Priest to consult Minerva at Athens.&lsquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;N.B. Old woman at Old Forest, promised her an oven,&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;<i>Leibnitz
      gives</i>&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! if he goes to Leibnitz,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia, &ldquo;he will be too grand for
      me, but it will do for you, mamma.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;&lsquo;Leibnitz gives in his Temple of the Destinies a representation of
      every possible universe from the worst to the best&mdash;This could not be
      done on the stage.&lsquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true indeed,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia; &ldquo;but, Helen, listen, Granville has
      really found an ingenious resource.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;&lsquo;By Ombres Chinoises, suppose; or a gauze curtain, as in Zemire et
      Azore, the audience might be made to understand the main point, that GOOD
      resulted from Tarquin&rsquo;s BAD choice. Brutus, Liberty, Rome&rsquo;s grandeur, and
      the Optimist right at last. Q.E.D.&lsquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; continued Lady Cecilia, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand it; but I
      understand this,&mdash;&lsquo;Bricks wanting.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Davenant smiled at this curious specimen of Beauclerc&rsquo;s versatility,
      but said, &ldquo;I fear he will fritter away his powers on a hundred different
      petty objects, and do nothing at last worthy of his abilities. He will
      scatter and divide the light of his genius, and show us every change of
      the prismatic colours&mdash;curious and beautiful to behold, but
      dispersing, wasting the light he should concentrate on some one, some
      noble object.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if he has light enough for little objects and great too?&rdquo; said Lady
      Cecilia, &ldquo;I allow, &lsquo;qu&rsquo;il faudrait plus d&rsquo;un coeur pour aimer tant de
      choses à la fois;&rsquo; but as I really think Granville has more heart than is
      necessary, he can well afford to waste some of it, even on the old woman
      at Old Forest.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      One evening, Helen was looking over a beautiful scrap-book of Lady
      Cecilia&rsquo;s. Beauclerc, who had stood by for some time, eyeing it in rather
      scornful silence, at length asked whether Miss Stanley was a lover of
      albums and autographs?
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen had no album of her own, she said, but she was curious always to see
      the autographs of celebrated people.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said Beauclerc.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. It seems to bring one nearer to them. It gives more reality
      to our imagination of them perhaps,&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The imagination is probably in most cases better than the reality,&rdquo;
       replied he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Davenant stooped over Helen&rsquo;s shoulder to look at the handwriting of
      the Earl of Essex&mdash;the writing of the gallant Earl of Essex, at sight
      of which, as she observed, the hearts of queens have beat high. &ldquo;What a
      crowd of associated ideas rise at the sight of that autograph! who can
      look at it without some emotion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen could not. Beauclerc in a tone of raillery said he was sure, from
      the eager interest Miss Stanley took in these autographs, that she would
      in time become a collector herself; and he did not doubt that he should
      see her with a valuable museum, in which should be preserved the old pens
      of great men, that of Cardinal Chigi, for instance, who boasted that he
      wrote with the same pen for fifty years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And by that boast you know,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant, &ldquo;convinced the Cardinal
      de Retz that he was not a great, but a very little man. We will not have
      that pen in Helen&rsquo;s museum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Beauclerc asked, &ldquo;it was full as well worth having as many of
      the relics to be found in most young ladies&rsquo; and even old gentlemen&rsquo;s
      museums. It was quite sufficient whether a man had been great or little
      that he had been talked of,&mdash;that he had been something of a <i>lion</i>&mdash;to
      make any thing belonging to him valuable to collectors, who preserve and
      worship even &lsquo;the parings of lions&rsquo; claws.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That class of indiscriminate collectors Helen gave up to his ridicule;
      still he was not satisfied. He went on to the whole class of
      &lsquo;lion-hunters,&rsquo; as he called them, condemning indiscriminately all those
      who were anxious to see celebrated people; he hoped Miss Stanley was not
      one of that class.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not a lion-hunter,&rdquo; said Helen; she hoped she never should be one of
      that set, but she confessed she had a great desire to see and to know
      distinguished persons, and she hoped that this sort of curiosity, or as
      she would rather call it enthusiasm, was not ridiculous, and did not
      deserve to be confounded with the mere trifling vulgar taste for
      sight-seeing and lion-hunting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauclerc half smiled, but, not answering immediately, Lady Davenant said,
      that for her part she did not consider such enthusiasm as ridiculous; on
      the contrary, she liked it, especially in young people. &ldquo;I consider the
      warm admiration of talent and virtue in youth as a promise of future
      excellence in maturer age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said Beauclerc, &ldquo;the maxim &lsquo;not to admire,&rsquo; is, I believe, the
      most approved in philosophy, and in practice is the great secret of
      happiness in this world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the <i>fine</i> world, it is a fine air, I know,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant.
      &ldquo;Among a set of fashionable young somnambulists it is doubtless the only
      art they know to make men happy or to keep them so; but this has nothing
      to do with philosophy, Beauclerc, though it has to do with conceit or
      affectation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Beauclerc, now piqued, with a look and voice of repressed feeling,
      said, that he hoped her ladyship did not include him among that set of
      fashionable somnambulists.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you will not include yourself in it,&rdquo; answered Lady Davenant: &ldquo;it
      is contrary to your nature, and if you join the <i>nil admirari</i>
      coxcombs, it can be only for fashion&rsquo;s sake&mdash;mere affectation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beauclerc made no reply, and Lady Davenant, turning to Helen, told her
      that several celebrated people were soon to come to Clarendon Park, and
      congratulated her upon the pleasure she would have in seeing them.
      &ldquo;Besides being a great pleasure, it is a real advantage,&rdquo; continued she,
      &ldquo;to see and be acquainted early in life with superior people. It enables
      one to form a standard of excellence, and raises that standard high and
      bright. In men, the enthusiasm becomes glorious ambition to excel in arts
      or arms; in women, it refines and elevates the taste, and is so far a
      preventive against frivolous, vulgar company, and all their train of
      follies and vices. I can speak from my own recollection, of the great
      happiness it was to me, when I early in life became acquainted with some
      of the illustrious of my day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And may I ask,&rdquo; said Beauclerc, &ldquo;if any of them equalled the expectations
      you had formed of them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some far exceeded them,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were fortunate. Every body cannot expect to be so happy,&rdquo; said
      Beauclerc. &ldquo;I believe, in general it is found that few great men of any
      times stand the test of near acquaintance. No man&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spare me!&rdquo; cried Lady Davenant, interrupting him, for she imagined she
      knew what he was going to say; &ldquo;Oh! spare me that old sentence, &lsquo;No man is
      a hero to his valet de chambre.&rsquo; I cannot endure to hear that for the
      thousandth time; I heartily wish it had never been said at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; replied Beauclerc; but Lady Davenant had turned away, and he
      now spoke in so low a voice, that only Helen heard him. &ldquo;So do I detest
      that quotation, not only for being hackneyed, but for having been these
      hundred years the comfort both of lean-jawed envy and fat mediocrity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took up one of Helen&rsquo;s pencils and began to cut it&mdash;he looked
      vexed, and low to her observed, &ldquo;Lady Davenant did not do me the honour to
      let me finish my sentence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;if Lady Davenant misunderstood you, why do not you
      explain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no it is not worth while, if she could so mistake me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But any body may be mistaken; do explain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said he, very diligently cutting the pencil to pieces; &ldquo;she is
      engaged, you see, with somebody&mdash;something else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But now she has done listening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, not now; there are too many people, and it&rsquo;s of no consequence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time the company were all eagerly talking of every remarkable
      person they had seen, or that they regretted not having seen. Lady Cecilia
      now called upon each to name the man among the celebrated of modern days,
      whom they should most liked to have seen. By acclamation they all named
      Sir Walter Scott, &lsquo;The Ariosto of the North!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      All but Beauclerc; he did not join the general voice; he said low to Helen
      with an air of disgust&mdash;&ldquo;How tired I am of hearing him called &lsquo;The
      Ariosto of the North!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But by whatever name,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;surely you join in that general wish
      to have seen him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I am sure of your vote,&rdquo; cried Lady Cecilia, coming up to them,
      &ldquo;You, Granville, would rather have seen Sir Walter Scott than any author
      since Shakespeare&mdash;would not you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, on the contrary, I am glad that I have never seen him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad not to have seen him!&mdash;<i>not</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The word <i>not</i> was repeated with astonished incredulous emphasis by
      all voices. &ldquo;Glad not to have seen Sir Walter Scott! How extraordinary!
      What can Mr. Beauclerc mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To make us all stare,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant, &ldquo;so do not gratify him. Do not
      wonder at him; we cannot believe what is impossible, you know, only
      because it is impossible. But,&rdquo; continued she, laughing, &ldquo;I know how it
      is. The spirit of contradiction&mdash;the spirit of singularity&mdash;two
      of your familiars, Granville, have got possession of you again, and we
      must have patience while the fit is on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have not, and will not have patience,&rdquo; said Lord Davenant, whose
      good-nature seldom failed, but who was now quite indignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder you are surprised, my dear Lord,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant, &ldquo;for Mr.
      Beauclerc likes so much better to go wrong by himself than to go right
      with all the world, that you could not expect that he would join the loud
      voice of universal praise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear the loud voice of universal execration,&rdquo; said Beauclerc; &ldquo;you have
      all abused me, but whom have I abused? What have I said?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; replied Lady Cecilia; &ldquo;that is what we complain of. I could
      have better borne any abuse than indifference to Sir Walter Scott.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indifference!&rdquo; exclaimed Beauclerc&mdash;&ldquo;what did I say Lady Cecilia,
      from which you could infer that I felt indifference? Indifferent to him
      whose name I cannot pronounce without emotion! I alone, of all the world,
      indifferent to that genius, pre-eminent and unrivalled, who has so long
      commanded the attention of the whole reading public, arrested at will the
      instant order of the day by tales of other times, and in this commonplace,
      this every-day existence of ours, created a holiday world, where,
      undisturbed by vulgar cares, we may revel in a fancy region of felicity,
      peopled with men of other times&mdash;shades of the historic dead, more
      illustrious and brighter than in life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the great Enchanter,&rdquo; cried Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great and good Enchanter,&rdquo; continued Beauclerc, &ldquo;for in his magic there
      is no dealing with unlawful means. To work his ends, there is never aid
      from any one of the bad passions of our nature. In his writings there is
      no private scandal&mdash;no personal satire&mdash;no bribe to human
      frailty&mdash;no libel upon human nature. And among the lonely, the sad,
      and the suffering, how has he medicined to repose the disturbed mind, or
      elevated the dejected spirit!&mdash;perhaps fanned to a flame the
      unquenched spark, in souls not wholly lost to virtue. His morality is not
      in purple patches, ostentatiously obtrusive, but woven in through the very
      texture of the stuff. He paints man as he is, with all his faults, but
      with his redeeming virtues&mdash;the world as it goes, with all its
      compensating good and evil, yet making each man better contented with his
      lot. Without our well knowing how, the whole tone of our minds is raised&mdash;for,
      thinking nobly of our kind, he makes us think more nobly of ourselves!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen, who had sympathised with Beauclerc in every word he had said, felt
      how true it is that
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;Next to genius, is the power Of feeling where true genius
      lies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet after all this, Granville,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia, &ldquo;you would make us
      believe you never wished to have seen this great man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beauclerc made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! how I wish I had seen him!&rdquo; said Helen to Lady Davenant, the only
      person present who had had that happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you have seen Raeburn&rsquo;s admirable pictures, or Chantrey&rsquo;s speaking
      bust,&rdquo; replied Lady Davenant, &ldquo;you have as complete an idea of Sir Walter
      Scott as painting or sculpture can give. The first impression of his
      appearance and manner was surprising to me, I recollect, from its quiet,
      unpretending good nature; but scarcely had that impression been made
      before I was struck with something of the chivalrous courtesy of other
      times. In his conversation you would have found all that is most
      delightful in all his works&mdash;the combined talent and knowledge of the
      historian, novelist, antiquary, and poet. He recited poetry admirably, his
      whole face and figure kindling as he spoke: but whether talking, reading,
      or reciting, he never tired me, even with admiring; and it is curious
      that, in conversing with him, I frequently found myself forgetting that I
      was speaking to Sir Walter Scott; and, what is even more extraordinary,
      forgetting that Sir Walter Scott was speaking to me, till I was awakened
      to the conviction by his saying something which no one else could have
      said. Altogether he was certainly the most perfectly agreeable and
      perfectly amiable great man I ever knew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, mamma,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia, &ldquo;do make Granville confess honestly
      he would give the world to have seen him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do, Lady Davenant,&rdquo; said Helen, who saw, or thought she saw, a singular
      emotion in Beauclerc&rsquo;s countenance, and fancied he was upon the point of
      yielding; but Lady Davenant, without looking at him, replied,&mdash;&ldquo;No,
      my dear, I will not ask him&mdash;I will not encourage him in <i>affectation</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that word dark grew the brow of Beauclerc, and he drew back, as it
      were, into his shell, and out of it came no more that night, nor the next
      morning at breakfast. But, as far as could be guessed, he suffered
      internally, and no effort made to relieve did him any good, so every one
      seemed to agree that it was much better to let him alone, or let him be
      moody in peace, hoping that in time the mood would change; but it changed
      not till the middle of that day, when, as Helen was sitting working in
      Lady Davenant&rsquo;s room, while she was writing, two quick knocks were heard
      at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; said Lady Davenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Beauclerc stood pausing on the threshold&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not go, Miss Stanley,&rdquo; said he, looking very miserable and ashamed,
      and proud, and then ashamed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter, Granville?&rdquo; said Lady Davenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am come to have a thorn taken out of my mind,&rdquo; said he&mdash;&ldquo;two
      thorns which have sunk deep, kept me awake half the night. Perhaps, I
      ought to be ashamed to own I have felt pain from such little things. But
      so it is; though, after all, I am afraid they will be invisible to you,
      Lady Davenant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will try with a magnifying-glass,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;lend me that of your
      imagination, Granville&mdash;a high power, and do not look so very
      miserable, or Miss Stanley will laugh at you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Stanley is too good to laugh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is being too good indeed,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant. &ldquo;Well, now to the
      point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were very unjust to me, Lady Davenant, yesterday, and unkind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unkind is a woman&rsquo;s word; but go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely man may mark &lsquo;unkindness&rsquo; altered eye&rsquo; as well as woman,&rdquo; said
      Beauclerc; &ldquo;and from a woman and a friend he may and must feel it, or he
      is more or less than man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now what can you have to say, Granville, that will not be anticlimax to
      this exordium?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will say no more if you talk of exordiums and anti-climaxes,&rdquo; cried he.
      &ldquo;You accused me yesterday of affectation&mdash;twice, when I was no more
      affected than you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! is that my crime? Is that, what has hurt you so dreadfully? Here is
      the thorn that has gone in so deep! I am afraid that, as is usual, the
      accusation hurt the more because it was&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not say &lsquo;true,&rsquo;&rdquo; interrupted Beauclerc, &ldquo;for you really cannot believe
      it, Lady Davenant. You know me, and all my faults, and I have plenty; but
      you need not accuse me of one that I have not, and which from the bottom
      of my soul I despise. Whatever are my faults, they are at least real, and
      my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may allow him that,&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well I will&mdash;I do,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant; &ldquo;to appease you, poor
      injured innocence; though anyone in the world might think you affected at
      this moment. Yet I, who know you, know that it is pure real folly. Yes,
      yes, I acquit you of affectation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beauclerc&rsquo;s face instantly cleared up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you said two thorns had gone into your mind&mdash;one is out, now for
      the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not feel that other, now,&rdquo; said Beauclerc, &ldquo;it was only a mistake.
      When I began with &lsquo;No man,&rsquo; I was not going to say, &lsquo;No man is a hero to
      his valet de chambre.&rsquo; If I had been allowed to finish my sentence, it
      would have saved a great deal of trouble, I was going to say that no man
      admires excellence more fervently than I do, and that my very reason for
      wishing not to see celebrated people is, lest the illusion should be
      dispelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No description ever gives us an exact idea of any person, so that when
      any one has been much described and talked of, before we see them we form
      in our mind&rsquo;s eye some image, some notion of our own, which always proves
      to be unlike the reality; and when we do afterwards see it, even if it be
      fairer or better than our imagination, still at first there is a sort of
      disappointment, from the non-agreement with our previously formed
      conception. Every body is disappointed the first time they see Hamlet, or
      Falstaff, as I think Dugald Stewart observes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True; and I remember,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant, &ldquo;Madame de la Rochejaquelin
      once said to me, &lsquo;I hate that people should come to see me. I know it
      destroys the illusion.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried Beauclerc; &ldquo;how much I dread to destroy any of those blessed
      illusions, which make the real happiness of life. Let me preserve the
      objects of my idolatry; I would not approach too near the shrine; I fear
      too much light. I would not know that they were false!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you then be deceived?&rdquo; said Lady Davenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;sooner would I believe in all the fables of the Talmud
      than be without the ecstasy of veneration. It is the curse of age to be
      thus miserably disenchanted; to outlive all our illusions, all our hopes.
      That may be my doom in age, but, in youth, the high spring-time of
      existence, I will not be cursed with such a premature ossification of the
      heart. Oh! rather, ten thousand times rather, would I die this instant!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! but there is not the least occasion for your dying,&rdquo; said Lady
      Davenant, &ldquo;and I am seriously surprised that you should suffer so much
      from such slight causes; how will you ever get through the world if you
      stop thus to weigh every light word?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The words of most people,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;pass by me like the idle wind;
      but I do weigh every word from the very few whom I esteem, admire, and
      love; with my friends, perhaps, I am too susceptible, I love them so
      deeply.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This is an excuse for susceptibility of temper which flatters friends too
      much to be easily rejected. Even Lady Davenant admitted it, and Helen
      thought it was all natural.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia was now impatient to have the house filled with company. She
      gave Helen a <i>catalogue raisonné</i> of all who were expected at
      Clarendon Park, some for a fashionable three days&rsquo; visit; some for a week;
      some for a fortnight or three weeks, be the same more or less. &ldquo;I have but
      one fixed principle,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;but I <i>have</i> one,&mdash;never to
      have tiresome people when it can possibly be avoided. Impossible, you
      know, it is sometimes. One&rsquo;s own and one&rsquo;s husband&rsquo;s relations one must
      have; but, as for the rest, it&rsquo;s one&rsquo;s own fault if one fails in the first
      and last maxim of hospitality&mdash;to welcome the coming and speed the
      parting guest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The first party who arrived were of Lady Davenant&rsquo;s particular friends, to
      whom Cecilia had kindly given the precedence, if not the preference, that
      her mother might have the pleasure of seeing them, and that they might
      have the honour of taking leave of her, before her departure from England.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were political, fashionable, and literary; some of ascendency in
      society, some of parliamentary promise, and some of ministerial eminence&mdash;the
      aristocracy of birth and talents well mixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The aristocracy of birth and the aristocracy of talents are words now used
      more as a commonplace antithesis, than as denoting a real difference or
      contrast. In many instances, among those now living, both are united in a
      manner happy for themselves and glorious for their country. England may
      boast of having among her young nobility
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">  &ldquo;The first in birth, the first in fame."<br /></pre>
    <p>
      men distinguished in literature and science, in senatorial eloquence and
      statesmanlike abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in this party at Clarendon Park there were more of the literary and
      celebrated than without the presence of Lady Davenant could perhaps have
      been assembled, or perhaps would have been desired by the general and Lady
      Cecilia. Cecilia&rsquo;s beauty and grace were of all societies, and the general
      was glad for Lady Davenant&rsquo;s sake and proud for his own part, to receive
      these distinguished persons at his house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen had seen some of them before at Cecilhurst and at the Deanery. By
      her uncle&rsquo;s friends she was kindly recognised, by others of course
      politely noticed; but miserably would she have been disappointed and
      mortified, if she had expected to fix general attention, or excite general
      admiration. Past and gone for ever are the days, if ever they were, when a
      young lady, on her entrance into life, captivated by a glance, overthrew
      by the first word, and led in triumph her train of admirers. These things
      are not to be done now-a-days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet even when unnoticed Helen was perfectly happy. Her expectations were
      more than gratified in seeing and in hearing these distinguished people,
      and she sat listening to their conversation in delightful enjoyment,
      without even wanting to have it seen how well she understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a precious moment for young people, if taken at the prime, when
      first introduced into society, yet not expected, not called upon to take a
      part in it, they, as standers by, may see not only all the play, but the
      characters of the players, and may learn more of life and of human nature
      in a few months, than afterwards in years, when they are themselves actors
      upon the stage of life, and become engrossed by their own parts. There is
      a time, before the passions are awakened, when the understanding, with all
      the life of nature, fresh from all that education can do to develop and
      cultivate, is at once eager to observe and able to judge, for a brief
      space blessed with the double advantages of youth and age. This time once
      gone is lost irreparably; and how often it is lost&mdash;in premature
      vanity, or premature dissipation!
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen had been chiefly educated by a man, and a very sensible man, as Dean
      Stanley certainly was in all but money matters. Under his masculine care,
      while her mind had been brought forward on some points, it had been kept
      back on others, and while her understanding had been cultivated, it had
      been done without the aid of emulation or competition; not by touching the
      springs of pride, but by opening sources of pure pleasure; and this pure
      pleasure she now enjoyed, grateful to that dear uncle. For the single
      inimitable grace of simplicity which she possessed, how many mothers,
      governesses, and young ladies themselves, willingly, when they see how
      much it charms, would too late exchange half the accomplishments, all the
      acquirements, so laboriously achieved!
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauclerc, who had seen something of the London female world, was, both
      from his natural taste and from contrast, pleased with Helen&rsquo;s fresh and
      genuine character, and he sympathised with all her silent delight. He
      never interrupted her in her enthusiastic contemplation of the great
      stars, but he would now and then seize an interval of rest to compare her
      observations with his own; anxious to know whether she estimated their
      relative magnitude and distances as he did. These snatched moments of
      comparison and proof of agreement in their observations, or the pleasure
      of examining the causes of their difference of opinion, enhanced the
      enjoyment of this brilliant fortnight; and not a cloud obscured the deep
      serene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding all the ultra-refined nonsense Beauclerc had talked about
      his wish not to see remarkable persons, no one could enjoy it more, as
      Helen now perceived; and she saw also that he was considered as a man of
      promise among all these men of performance. But there were some, perhaps
      very slight things, which raised him still more in her mind, because they
      showed superiority of character. She observed his manner towards the
      general in this company, where he had himself the &lsquo;vantage ground&mdash;so
      different now from what it had been in the Old-Forest battle, when only
      man to man, ward to guardian. Before these distinguished persons there was
      a look&mdash;a tone of deference at once most affectionate and polite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so generous,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia to Helen; &ldquo;is not it?&rdquo; and Helen
      agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This brilliant fortnight ended too soon, as Helen thought, but Lady
      Cecilia had had quite enough of it. &ldquo;They are all to go to-morrow morning,
      and I am not sorry for it,&rdquo; said she at night, as she threw herself into
      an arm-chair, in Helen&rsquo;s room; and, after having indulged in a refreshing
      yawn, she exclaimed, &ldquo;Very delightful, very delightful! as you say, Helen,
      it has all been; but I am not sure that I should not be very much tired if
      I had much more of it. Oh! yes, I admired them all amazingly, but then
      admiring all day long is excessively wearisome. The very attitude of
      looking up fatigues both body and mind. Mamma is never tired, because she
      never has to look up; she can always look down, and that&rsquo;s so grand and so
      easy. She has no idea how the neck of my poor mind aches this minute; and
      my poor eyes! blasted with excess of light. How yours have stood it so
      well, Helen, I cannot imagine! how much stronger they must be than mine. I
      must confess, that, without the relief of music now and then, and ecarté,
      and that quadrille, bad as it was, I should never have got through it
      to-night alive or awake. But,&rdquo; cried she, starting up in her chair, &ldquo;do
      you know Horace Churchill stays to-morrow. Such a compliment from him to
      stay a day longer than he intended! And do you know what he says of your
      eyes, Helen?&mdash;that they are the best listeners he ever spoke to. I
      should warn you though, my dear, that he is something, and not a little, I
      believe, of a male coquette. Though he is not very young, but he well
      understands all the advantages of a careful toilette. He has, like that
      George Herbert in Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s time, &lsquo;a genteel humour for dress.&rsquo; He
      is handsome still, and his fine figure, and his fine feelings, and his
      fine fortune, have broken two or three hearts; nevertheless I am delighted
      that he stays, especially that he stays on your account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my account!&rdquo; exclaimed Helen. &ldquo;Did not you see that, from the first
      day when Mr. Churchill had the misfortune to be placed beside me at
      dinner, he utterly despised me: he began to talk to me, indeed, but left
      his sentence unfinished, his good story untold, the instant he caught the
      eye of a grander auditor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia had seen this, and marvelled at a well-bred man so far
      forgetting himself in vanity; but this, she observed, was only the first
      day; he had afterwards changed his manner towards Helen completely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, when he saw Lady Davenant thought me worth speaking to. But, after
      all, it was quite natural that he should not know well what to say to me.
      I am only a young lady. I acquit him of all peculiar rudeness to me, for I
      am sure Mr. Churchill really could not talk for only one insignificant
      hearer, could not bring out his good things, unless he felt secure of
      possessing the attention of the whole dinner-table, so I quite forgive
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After this curse of forgiveness, my dear Helen, I will wish you a good
      night,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia, laughing; and she retired with a fear that
      there would not be jealousy enough between the gentlemen, or that Helen
      would not know how to play them one against another.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a pleasure in seeing a large party disperse; in staying behind
      when others go:&mdash;there is advantage as well as pleasure, which is
      felt by the timid, because they do not leave their characters behind them;
      and rejoiced in by the satirical, because the characters of the departed
      and departing are left behind, fair game for them. Of this advantage no
      one could be more sensible, no one availed himself of it with more
      promptitude and skill, than Mr. Churchill: for well he knew that though
      wit may fail, humour may not take&mdash;though even flattery may pall upon
      the sense, scandal, satire, and sarcasm, are resources never failing for
      the lowest capacities, and sometimes for the highest.
    </p>
    <p>
      This morning, in the library at Clarendon Park, he looked out of the
      window at the departing guests, and, as each drove off, he gave to each
      his <i>coup de patte</i>. To Helen, to whom it was new, it was wonderful
      to see how each, even of those next in turn to go, enjoyed the demolition
      of those who were just gone; how, blind to fate, they laughed, applauded,
      and licked the hand just raised to strike themselves. Of the first who
      went&mdash;&ldquo;Most respectable people,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia; &ldquo;a <i>bonne mère
      de famille</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most respectable people!&rdquo; repeated Horace&mdash;&ldquo;most respectable people,
      old coach and all.&rdquo; And then, as another party drove off&mdash;&ldquo;No fear of
      any thing truly respectable here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Horace, how can you say so?&mdash;she is so amiable and so clever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So clever? only, perhaps, a thought too fond of English liberty and
      French dress. <i>Poissarde bien coiffée</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Poissarde!</i> of one of the best born, best bred women in England!&rdquo;
       cried Lady Cecilia; &ldquo;<i>bien coiffée</i>, I allow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Cecilia is <i>si coiffée de sa belle amie</i>, that I see I must not
      say a word against her, till&mdash;the fashion changes. But, hark! I hear
      a voice I never wish to hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet nobody is better worth hearing&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, the queen of the Blues&mdash;the Blue Devils!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; cried the aide-de-camp, &ldquo;she is coming in to take leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, as the queen of the Blue Devils entered, Mr. Churchill, in the most
      humbly respectful manner, begged&mdash;&ldquo;My respects&mdash;I trust your
      grace will do me the favour&mdash;the justice to remember me to all your
      party who&mdash;do me the honour to bear me in mind&mdash;&rdquo; then, as she
      left the room, he turned about and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you sad, false man!&rdquo; cried the lady next in turn to go. &ldquo;I declare,
      Mr. Churchill, though I laugh, I am quite afraid to go off before you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid! what could malice or envy itself find to say of your ladyship, <i>intacte</i>
      as you are?&mdash;<i>Intacte!</i>&rdquo; repeated he, as she drove off, &ldquo;<i>intacte!</i>&mdash;a
      well chosen epithet, I flatter myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, <i>intacte</i>&mdash;untouched&mdash;above the breath of slander,&rdquo;
       cried Lady Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it: so I say,&rdquo; replied Churchill: &ldquo;fidelity that has stood all
      temptations&mdash;to which it has ever been exposed; and her husband is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A near relation of mine,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia. &ldquo;I am not prudish as to
      scandal in general,&rdquo; continued she, laughing; &ldquo;&lsquo;a chicken, too, might do
      me good,&rsquo; but then the fox must not prey at home. No one ought to stand by
      and hear their own relations abused.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand pardons! I depended too much on the general maxim&mdash;that
      the nearer the bone the sweeter the slander.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I meant to say, the nearer the heart the dearer the blame. A cut against
      a first cousin may go wrong&mdash;but a bosom friend&mdash;oh! how I have
      succeeded against best friends; scolded all the while, of course, and
      called a monster. But there is Sir Stephen bowing to you.&rdquo; Then, as Lady
      Cecilia kissed her hand to him from the window, Churchill went on: &ldquo;By the
      by, without any scandal, seriously I heard something&mdash;I was quite
      concerned&mdash;that he had been of late less in his study and more in the
      boudoir of &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. Surely it cannot be true!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Positively false,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At every breath a reputation dies,&rdquo; said Beauclerc.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Pon my soul, that&rsquo;s true!&rdquo; said the aide-de-camp. &ldquo;Positively, hit or
      miss, Horace has been going on, firing away with his wit, pop, pop, pop!
      till he has bagged&mdash;how many brace?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace turned away from him contemptuously, and looked to see whereabouts
      Lady Davenant might be all this time.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lady Davenant was at the far end of the room engrossed, Churchill feared,
      by the newspaper; as he approached she laid it down, and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How scandalous some of these papers have become, but it is the fault of
      the taste of the age. &lsquo;Those who live to please, must please to live.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace was not sure whether he was cut or not, but he had the presence of
      mind not to look hurt. He drew nearer to Lady Davenant, seated himself,
      and taking up a book as if he was tired of folly, to which he had merely
      condescended, he sat and read, and then sat and thought, the book hanging
      from his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result of these profound thoughts he gave to the public, not to the
      aide-de-camp; no more of the little pop-gun pellets of wits&mdash;but now
      was brought out reason and philosophy. In a higher tone he now reviewed
      the literary, philosophical, and political world, with touches of La
      Bruyere and Rochefoucault in the characters he drew and in the reflections
      he made; with an air, too, of sentimental contrition for his own
      penetration and fine moral sense, which compelled him to see and to be
      annoyed by the faults of such superior men.
    </p>
    <p>
      The analysis he made of every mind was really perfect&mdash;in one
      respect, not a grain of bad but was separated from the good, and held up
      clean and clear to public view. And as an anatomist he showed such
      knowledge both of the brain and of the heart, such an admirable
      acquaintance with all their diseases and handled the probe and the scalpel
      so well, with such a practised hand!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, really this is comfortable,&rdquo; said Lord Davenant, throwing himself
      back in his arm-chair&mdash;&ldquo;True English comfort, to sit at ease and see
      all one&rsquo;s friends so well dissected! Happy to feel that it is our duty to
      our neighbour to see him well cut up&mdash;ably anatomised for the good of
      society; and when I depart&mdash;when my time comes&mdash;as come it must,
      nobody is to touch me but Professor Churchill. It will be a satisfaction
      to know that I shall be carved as a dish fit for gods, not hewed as a
      carcase for hounds. So now remember, Cecilia, I call on you to witness&mdash;I
      hereby, being of sound mind and body, leave and bequeath my character,
      with all my defects and deficiencies whatsoever, and all and any singular
      curious diseases of the mind, of which I may die possessed, wishing the
      same many for his sake,&mdash;to my good friend Doctor Horace Churchill,
      professor of moral, philosophic, and scandalous anatomy, to be by him
      dissected at his good pleasure for the benefit of society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many thanks, my good lord; and I accept your legacy for the honour&mdash;not
      the value of the gift, which every body must be sensible is nothing,&rdquo; said
      Churchill, with a polite bow&mdash;&ldquo;absolutely nothing. I shall never be
      able to make anything of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try&mdash;try, my dear friend,&rdquo; answered Lord Davenant. &ldquo;Try, don&rsquo;t be
      modest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be difficult when so distinguished,&rdquo; said Beauclerc, with an
      admirable look of proud humility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Distinguished Mr. Horace Churchill assuredly is,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant,
      looking at him from behind her newspaper. &ldquo;Distinguished above all his
      many competitors in this age of scandal; he has really raised the art to
      the dignity of a science. Satire, scandal, and gossip, now hand-in-hand&mdash;the
      three new graces: all on the same elevated rank&mdash;three, formerly
      considered as so different, and the last left to our inferior sex, but
      now, surely, to be a male gossip is no reproach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, Lady Davenant!&mdash;male gossip&mdash;what an expression!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a reality!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Male gossip!&mdash;&lsquo;<i>Tombe sur moi le ciel!</i>&rsquo;&rdquo; cried Churchill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Pourvu que je me venge</i>,&rsquo; always understood,&rdquo; pursued Lady
      Davenant; &ldquo;but why be so afraid of the imputation of gossiping, Mr.
      Churchill? It is quite fashionable, and if so, quite respectable, you
      know, and in your style quite grand.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">  &ldquo;And gossiping wonders at being so fine&mdash;<br /></pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Malice, to be hated, needs but to be seen, but now when it is elegantly
      dressed we look upon it without shame or consciousness of evil; we grow to
      doat upon it&mdash;so entertaining, so graceful, so refined. When vice
      loses half its grossness, it loses all its deformity. Humanity used to be
      talked of when our friends were torn to pieces, but now there is such a
      philosophical perfume thrown over the whole operation, that we are
      irresistibly attracted. How much we owe to such men as Mr. Churchill, who
      make us feel detraction virtue!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed low as Lady Davenant, summoned by her lord, left the room, and
      there he stood as one condemned but not penitent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I have not been well sentenced,&rdquo; said he, as the door closed, &ldquo;and
      made &lsquo;<i>to feel detraction virtue</i>!&rsquo;&mdash;But since Lady Cecilia
      cannot help smiling at that, I am acquitted, and encouraged to sin again
      the first opportunity. But Lady Davenant shall not be by, nor Lord
      Davenant either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia sat down to write a note, and Mr. Churchill walked round the
      room in a course of critical observation on the pictures, of which, as of
      every thing else, he was a supreme judge. At last he put his eye and his
      glass down to something which singularly attracted his attention on one of
      the marble tables.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty!&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia, &ldquo;pretty are not they?&mdash;though one&rsquo;s so
      tired of them every where now&mdash;those doves!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doves!&rdquo; said Churchill, &ldquo;what I am admiring are gloves, are not they,
      Miss Stanley?&rdquo; said he, pointing to an old pair of gloves, which, much
      wrinkled and squeezed together, lay on the beautiful marble in rather an
      unsightly lump.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Doctor V&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; cried Helen to Cecilia; &ldquo;that poor
      Doctor V&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-is as absent as ever! he is gone, and has
      forgotten his gloves!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absent! oh, as ever!&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia, going on with her note, &ldquo;the
      most absent man alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too much of that sort of thing I think there is in Doctor V&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-,&rdquo;
       pursued Churchill: &ldquo;a touch of absence of mind, giving the idea of high
      abstraction, becomes a learned man well enough; but then it should only be
      slight, as a <i>soupçon</i> of rouge, which may become a pretty woman; all
      depends on the measure, the taste, with which these things are managed&mdash;put
      on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing managed, nothing <i>put on</i> in Doctor V&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo;
       cried Helen, eagerly, her colour rising; &ldquo;it is all perfectly sincere,
      true in him, whatever it be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beauclerc put down his book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All perfectly true! You really think so, Miss Stanley?&rdquo; said Churchill,
      smiling, and looking superior down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do, indeed,&rdquo; cried Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charming&mdash;so young! How I do love that freshness of mind!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impertinent fellow! I could knock him down, felt Beauclerc.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you think all Doctor V&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s humility true?&rdquo; said
      Churchill. &ldquo;Yes, perfectly!&rdquo; said Helen; &ldquo;but I do not wonder you are
      surprised at it, Mr. Churchill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She meant no <i>malice</i>, though for a moment he thought she did; and he
      winced under Beauclerc&rsquo;s smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not wonder that any one who does not know Doctor V&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      should be surprised by his great humility,&rdquo; added Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are sure that it is not pride that apes humility?&rdquo; asked Churchill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, quite sure!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet&mdash;&rdquo; said Churchill (putting his malicious finger through a great
      hole in the thumb of the doctor&rsquo;s glove) &ldquo;I should have fancied that I saw
      vanity through the holes in these gloves, as through the philosopher&rsquo;s
      cloak of old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horace is a famous fellow for picking holes and making much of them, Miss
      Stanley, you see,&rdquo; said the aide-de-camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vanity! Doctor V&mdash;&mdash;has no vanity!&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;if you knew
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No vanity! Whom does Miss Stanley mean?&rdquo; cried the aide-de-camp. &ldquo;No
      vanity? that&rsquo;s good. Who? Horace?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mauvais plaisant</i>!&rdquo; Horace put him by, and, happily not easily put
      out of countenance, he continued to Helen,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You give the good doctor credit, too, for all his <i>naïveté</i>?&rdquo; said
      Churchill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does not want credit for it,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;he really has it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could see things as you do, Miss Stanley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show him that, Helen,&rdquo; cried Lady Cecilia, looking at a table beside
      them, on which lay one of those dioramic prints which appear all a
      confusion of lines till you look at them in their right point of view.
      &ldquo;Show him that&mdash;it all depends, and so does seeing characters, on
      getting the right point of view.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ingenious!&rdquo; said Churchill, trying to catch the right position; &ldquo;but I
      can&rsquo;t, I own&mdash;&rdquo; then abruptly resuming, &ldquo;Navïeté charms me at
      fifteen,&rdquo; and his eye glanced at Helen, then was retracted, then returning
      to his point of view, &ldquo;at eighteen perhaps may do,&rdquo; and his eyes again
      turned to Helen, &ldquo;at eighteen&mdash;it captivates me quite,&rdquo; and his eye
      dwelt. &ldquo;But naïveté at past fifty, verging to sixty, is quite another
      thing, really rather too much for me. I like all things in season, and
      above all, simplicity will not bear long keeping. I have the greatest
      respect possible for our learned and excellent friend, but I wish this
      could be any way suggested to him, and that he would lay aside this
      out-of-season simplicity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He cannot lay aside his nature,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;and I am glad of it, it is
      such a good nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kind-hearted creature he is, I never heard him say a severe word of any
      one,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a sweet man he must he!&rdquo; said Horace, making a face at which none
      present, not even Helen, could forbear to smile. &ldquo;His heart, I am sure, is
      in the right place always. I only wish one could say the same of his wig.
      And would it be amiss if he sometimes (I would not be too hard upon him,
      Miss Stanley), once a fortnight, suppose&mdash;brushed, or caused to be
      brushed, that coat of his?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have dusted his jacket for him famously, Horace, I think,&rdquo; said the
      aide-de-camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this instant the door opened, and in came the doctor himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s hand was outstretched with her note, thinking, as the door
      opened, that she should see the servant come in, for whom she had rung.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What surprises you all so, my good friends,&rdquo; said the doctor, stopping
      and looking round in all his native simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear doctor&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia, &ldquo;only we all thought you were gone&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am not gone, that&rsquo;s all. I stayed to write a letter, and am come
      here to look for&mdash;but I cannot find-my&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your gloves, perhaps, doctor, you are looking for,&rdquo; said Churchill, going
      forward, and with an air of the greatest respect and consideration, both
      for the gloves and for their owner, he presented them; then shook the
      doctor by the hand, with a cordiality which the good soul thought truly
      English, and, bowing him out, added, &ldquo;How proud he had been to make his
      acquaintance,&mdash;<i>au revoir</i>, he hoped, in Park Lane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh you treacherous&mdash;!&rdquo; cried Lady Cecilia, turning to Horace, as
      soon as the unsuspecting philosopher was fairly gone. &ldquo;Too bad really! If
      he were not the most simple-minded creature extant, he must have seen,
      suspected, something from your look; and what would have become of you if
      the doctor had come in one moment sooner, and had heard you&mdash;I was
      really frightened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frightened! so was I, almost out of my wits,&rdquo; said Churchill. &ldquo;<i>Les
      revenans</i> always frighten one; and they never hear any good of
      themselves, for which reason I make it a principle, when once I have left
      a room, full of friends especially, never&mdash;never to go back. My
      gloves, my hat, my coat, I&rsquo;d leave, sooner than lose my friends. Once I
      heard it said, by one who knew the world and human nature better than any
      of us&mdash;once I heard it said in jest, but in sober earnest I say, that
      I would not for more than I am worth be placed, without his knowing it,
      within earshot of my best friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of a best friend can yours he?&rdquo; cried Beauclerc.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much like other people&rsquo;s, I suppose,&rdquo; replied Horace, speaking with
      perfect nonchalance&mdash;&ldquo;much like other people&rsquo;s best friends.
      Whosoever expects to find better, I guess, will find worse, if he live in
      the world we live in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I go out of the world before I believe or suspect any such thing?&rdquo;
       cried Beauclerc. &ldquo;Rather than have the Roman curse light upon me, &lsquo;May you
      survive all your friends and relations!&rsquo; may I die a thousand times!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who talks of dying, in a voice so sweet&mdash;a voice so loud?&rdquo; said
      provoking Horace, in his calm, well-bred tone; &ldquo;for my part, I who have
      the honour of speaking to you, can boast, that never since I was of years
      of discretion (counting new style, beginning at thirteen, of course)&mdash;never
      have I lost a friend, a sincere friend&mdash;never, for this irrefragable
      reason&mdash;since that nonage, never was I such a neophyte as to fancy I
      had found that <i>lusus natures</i>, a friend perfectly sincere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How I pity you!&rdquo; cried Beauclerc, &ldquo;if you are in earnest; but in earnest
      you can&rsquo;t be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, I can, and I am. And in earnest you will oblige me, Mr.
      Beauclerc, if you will spare me your pity: for, all things in this world
      considered,&rdquo; said Horace Churchill, drawing himself up, &ldquo;I do not conceive
      that I am much an object of pity.&rdquo; Then, turning upon his heel, he walked
      away, conscious, however, half an instant afterwards, that he had drawn
      himself up too high, and that for a moment his temper had spoiled his
      tone, and betrayed him into a look and manner too boastful, bordering on
      the ridiculous. He was in haste to repair the error.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not Garrick, in the height of his celebrity and of his susceptibility, was
      ever more anxious than Horace Churchill to avert the stroke of ridicule&mdash;to
      guard against the dreaded smile. As he walked away, he felt behind his
      back that those he left were smiling in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia had thrown herself on a sofa, resting, after the labour of <i>l&rsquo;éloquence
      de billet</i>. He stopped, and, leaning over the back of the sofa on which
      she reclined, repeated an Italian line in which was the word &ldquo;<i>pavoneggiarsi</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Lady Cecilia, you, who understand and feel Italian so well, how
      expressive are some of their words! <i>Pavoneggiarsi!</i>&mdash;untranslatable.
      One cannot say well in English, to peacock oneself. To make oneself like
      unto a peacock is flat; but <i>pavoneggiarsi</i>&mdash;action, passion,
      picture, all in one! To plume oneself comes nearest to it; but the word
      cannot be given, even by equivalents, in English; nor can it be
      naturalised, because, in fact, we have not the feeling. An Englishman is
      too proud to boast&mdash;too bashful to strut; if ever he <i>peacocks
      himself</i>, it is in a moment of anger, not in display. The language of
      every country,&rdquo; continued he, raising his voice, in order to reach Lady
      Davenant, who just then returned to the room, as he did not wish to waste
      a philosophical observation on Lady Cecilia,&mdash;&ldquo;the language of every
      country is, to a certain degree, evidence, record, history of its
      character and manners.&rdquo; Then, lowering his voice almost to a whisper, but
      very distinct, turning while he spoke so as to make sure that Miss Stanley
      heard&mdash;&ldquo;Your young friend this morning quite captivated me by her
      nature&mdash;nature, the thing that now is most uncommon, a real natural
      woman; and when in a beauty, how charming! How delicious when one meets
      with <i>effusion de coeur</i>: a young lady, too, who speaks pure English,
      not a leash of languages at once; and cultivated, too, your friend is, for
      one does not like ignorance, if one could have knowledge without
      pretension&mdash;so hard to find the golden mean!&mdash;and if one could
      find it, one might not be nearer to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia listened for the finishing word, but none came. It all ended
      in a sigh, to be interpreted as she pleased. A look towards the ottoman,
      where Beauclerc had now taken his seat beside Miss Stanley, seemed to
      point the meaning out: but Lady Cecilia knew her man too well to
      understand him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauclerc, seated on the ottoman, was showing to Helen some passages in
      the book he was reading; she read with attention, and from time to time
      looked up with a smile of intelligence and approbation. What either said
      Horace could not hear, and he was the more curious, and when the book was
      put down, after carelessly opening others he took it up. Very much
      surprised was he to find it neither novel nor poem: many passages were
      marked with pencil notes of approbation, he took it for granted these were
      Bleauclerc&rsquo;s; there he was mistaken, they were Lady Davenant&rsquo;s. She was at
      her work-table. Horace, book in hand, approached; the book was not in his
      line, it was more scientific than literary&mdash;it was for posterity more
      than for the day; he had only turned it over as literary men turn over
      scientific books, to seize what may serve for a new simile or a good
      allusion; besides, among his philosophical friends, the book being talked
      of, it was well to know enough of it to have something to say, and he had
      said well, very <i>judiciously</i> he had praised it among the elect; but
      now it was his fancy to depreciate it with all his might; not that he
      disliked the author or the work now more than he had done before, but he
      was in the humour to take the opposite side from Beauclerc, so he threw
      the book from him contemptuously &ldquo;Rather a slight hasty thing, in my
      opinion,&rdquo; said he. Beauclerc&rsquo;s eyes took fire as he exclaimed, &ldquo;Slight!
      hasty! this most noble, most solid work!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Solid in your opinion,&rdquo; said Churchill, with a smile deferential,
      slightly sneering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our own opinion is all that either of us can give,&rdquo; said Beauclerc; &ldquo;in
      my opinion it is the finest view of the progress of natural philosophy,
      the most enlarged, the most just in its judgments of the past, and in its
      prescience of the future; in the richness of experimental knowledge, in
      its theoretic invention, the greatest work by any one individual since the
      time of Bacon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Bacon is under your protection, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Protection! my protection?&rdquo; said Beauclerc.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, I simply meant to ask if you are one of those who swear by
      Lord Verulam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear by no man, I do not swear at all, not on philosophical subjects
      especially; swearing adds nothing to faith,&rdquo; said Beauclerc.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I stand corrected,&rdquo; said Churchill, &ldquo;and I would go further, and add that
      in argument enthusiasm adds nothing to reason&mdash;much as I admire, as
      we all admire,&rdquo; glancing at Miss Stanley, &ldquo;that enthusiasm with which this
      favoured work has been advocated!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not help speaking warmly,&rdquo; cried Beauclerc; &ldquo;it is a book to
      inspire enthusiasm; there is such a noble spirit all through it, so pure
      from petty passions, from all vulgar jealousies, all low concerns! Judge
      of a book, somebody says, by the impression it leaves on your mind when
      you lay it down; this book stands that test, at least with me, I lay it
      down with such a wish to follow&mdash;with steps ever so unequal still to
      follow, where it points the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo! bravissimo! hear him, hear him! print him, print him! hot-press
      from the author to the author, hot-press!&rdquo; cried Churchill, and he
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like one suddenly awakened from the trance of enthusiasm by the cold touch
      of ridicule, stood Beauclerc, brought down from heaven to earth, and by
      that horrid little laugh, not the heart&rsquo;s laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my being ridiculous does not make my cause so, and that is a
      comfort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And another comfort you may have, my dear Granville,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant,
      &ldquo;that ridicule is not the test of truth; truth should be the test of
      ridicule.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where is the book?&rdquo; continued Beauclerc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen gave it to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mr. Churchill,&rdquo; said Beauclerc; &ldquo;I am really anxious, I know you are
      such a good critic, will you show me these faults? blame as well as praise
      must always be valuable from those who themselves excel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are too good,&rdquo; said Churchill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you then be good enough to point out the errors for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, by no means,&rdquo; cried Churchill, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t note me, do not quote me, I am
      nobody, and I cannot give up my authorities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the truth is all I want to get at,&rdquo; said Beauclerc.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let her rest, my dear sir, at the bottom of her well; there she is, and
      there she will be for ever and ever, and depend upon it none of our
      windlassing will ever bring her up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such an author as this,&rdquo; continued Beauclerc, &ldquo;would have been so glad to
      have corrected any error.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So every author tells you, but I never saw one of them who did not look
      blank at a list of errata&mdash;if you knew how little one is thanked for
      them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you would be thanked now,&rdquo; said Beauclerc:&mdash;&ldquo;the faults in
      style, at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, I am no critic,&rdquo; said Churchill, confident in his habits of literary
      detection; &ldquo;but if you ask me,&rdquo; said he, as he disdainfully flirted the
      leaves back and forward with a &ldquo;There now!&rdquo; and a &ldquo;Here now!&rdquo; &ldquo;We should
      not call that good writing&mdash;you could not think this correct? I may
      be wrong, but I should not use this phrase. Hardly English that&mdash;colloquial,
      I think; and this awkward ablative absolute&mdash;never admitted now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Beauclerc, &ldquo;these faults are easily mended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easily mended, say you? I say, better make a new one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WHO COULD?&rdquo; said Beauclerc.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many faults you see,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;which I should never have
      perceived unless you had pointed them out, and I am sorry to know them
      now.&rdquo; Smiling at Helen&rsquo;s look of sincere mortification, in contrast at
      this moment with Mr. Churchill&rsquo;s air of satisfied critical pride, Lady
      Davenant said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why sorry, my dear Helen? No human work can be perfect; Mr. Churchill may
      be proud of that strength of eye which in such a powerful light can count
      the spots. But whether it be the best use to make of his eyes, or the best
      use that can be made of the light, remains to be considered.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Beyond measure was Churchill provoked to find Lady Davenant against him
      and on the same side as Granville Beauclerc&mdash;all unused to
      contradiction in his own society, where he had long been supreme, he felt
      a difference of opinion so sturdily maintained as a personal insult.
    </p>
    <p>
      For so young a man as Beauclerc, yet unknown to fame, not only to
      challenge the combat but to obtain the victory, was intolerable; and the
      more so, because his young opponent appeared no ways elated or surprised,
      but seemed satisfied to attribute his success to the goodness of his
      cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Churchill had hitherto always managed wisely his great stakes and
      pretensions in both the fashionable and literary world. He had never
      actually published any thing except a clever article or two in a review,
      or an epigram, attributed to him but not acknowledged. Having avoided
      giving his measure, it was believed he was above all who had been publicly
      tried&mdash;it was always said&mdash;&ldquo;If Horace Churchill would but
      publish, he would surpass every other author of our times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Churchill accordingly dreaded and hated all who might by possibility
      approach the throne of fashion, or interfere with his dictatorship in a
      certain literary set in London, and from this moment he began cordially to
      detest Beauclerc&mdash;he viewed him with a scornful, yet with jealous
      eyes; but his was the jealousy of vanity, not of love; it regarded Lady
      Davenant and his fashionable reputation in the first place&mdash;Helen
      only in the second.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Davenant observed all this, and was anxious to know how much or how
      little Helen had seen, and what degree of interest it excited in her mind.
      One morning, when they were alone together, looking over a cabinet of
      cameos, Lady Davenant pointed to one which she thought like Mr. Beauclerc.
      Helen did not see the likeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People see likenesses very differently,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant. &ldquo;But you and
      I, Helen, usually see characters, if not faces, with the same eyes. I have
      been thinking of these two gentlemen, Mr. Churchill and Mr. Beauclerc&mdash;which
      do you think the most agreeable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Churchill is amusing certainly,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;but I think Mr.
      Beauclerc&rsquo;s conversation much more interesting&mdash;though Mr. Churchill
      is agreeable, sometimes&mdash;when&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When he flatters you,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When he is not satirical&mdash;I was going to say,&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a continual petty brilliancy, a petty effort too,&rdquo; continued
      Lady Davenant, &ldquo;in Mr. Churchill, that tires me&mdash;sparks struck
      perpetually, but then you hear the striking of the flints, the clink of
      the tinder-box.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen, though she admitted the tinder-box, thought it too low a
      comparison. She thought Churchill&rsquo;s were not mere sparks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, fireworks, if you will,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant, &ldquo;that rise, blaze,
      burst, fall, and leave you in darkness, and with a disagreeable smell too;
      and it&rsquo;s all <i>feu d&rsquo;artifice</i> after all. Now in Beauclerc there is
      too little art and too ardent nature. Some French friends of mine who knew
      both, said of Mr. Churchill, &lsquo;<i>De l&rsquo;esprit on ne peut pas plus même à
      Paris</i>,&rsquo; the highest compliment a Parisian can pay, but they allowed
      that Beauclerc had &lsquo;<i>beaucoup plus d&rsquo;ame</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Helen; &ldquo;how far superior!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has been said,&rdquo; continued Lady Davenant, &ldquo;that it is safer to judge of
      men by their actions than by their words, but there are few actions and
      many words in life; and if women would avail themselves of their daily,
      hourly, opportunities of judging people by their words, they would get at
      the natural characters, or, what is of just as much consequence, they
      would penetrate through the acquired habits; and here Helen, you have two
      good studies before you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Preoccupied as Helen was with the certainty of Beauclerc being an engaged,
      almost a married man, and looking, as she did, on Churchill as one who
      must consider her as utterly beneath his notice, she listened to Lady
      Davenant&rsquo;s remarks as she would have done to observations about two
      characters in a novel or on the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Churchill could not immediately manifest his hatred of Beauclerc, it
      worked inwardly the more. He did not sleep well this night, and when he
      got up in the morning, there was something the matter with him. Nervous,
      bilious&mdash;cross it could not be;&mdash;<i>journalier</i> (a French
      word settles everything)&mdash;<i>journalier</i> he allowed he was; he
      rather gloried in it, because his being permitted to be so proved his
      power,&mdash;his prerogative of fortune and talent combined.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the vast competition of the London world, it is not permitted to every
      man to be in his humour or out of his humour at pleasure; but, by an
      uncommon combination of circumstances, Churchill had established his
      privilege of caprice; he was allowed to have his bad and his good days,
      and the highest people and the finest smiled, and submitted to his &ldquo;<i>cachet
      de faveur et de disgrace</i>;&rdquo; and when he was sulky, rude, or snappish,
      called it only Horace Churchill&rsquo;s way. They even prided themselves on his
      preferences and his aversions. &ldquo;Horace is always charming when he is with
      us.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;With me you have no idea how delightful he is.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Indeed
      I must do him the justice to say, that I never found him otherwise.&rdquo;&mdash;While
      the less favoured permitted him to be as rude as he pleased, and only
      petted him, and told of his odd ways to those who sighed in vain to have
      him at their parties. But Lady Davenant was not a person to pet or spoil a
      child of any age, and to the general, Mr. Churchill was not particularly
      agreeable&mdash;not his sort; while to Lady Cecilia, secure in grace,
      beauty, and fashion, his humours were only matter of amusement, and she
      bore with him pleasantly and laughingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such weather!&rdquo; cried he in a querulous tone; &ldquo;how can a man have any
      sense in such weather? Some foreigner says, that the odious climate of
      England is an over-balance for her good constitution. The sun of the south
      is in truth well worth the liberty of the north. It is a sad thing,&rdquo; said
      he, with a very sentimental air, &ldquo;that a free-born Briton should be
      servile to these skyey influences;&rdquo; and, grumbling on, he looked out of
      the window as cross as he pleased, and nobody minded him. The aide-de-camp
      civilly agreed with him that it was horrid weather, and likely to rain,
      and it did rain; and every one knows how men, like children, are in
      certain circumstances affected miserably by a rainy day. There was no
      going out; horses at the door, and obliged to be dismissed. Well, since
      there could be no riding, the next best thing the aide-de-camp thought,
      was to talk of horses, and the officers all grew eager, and Churchill had
      a mind to exert himself so far as to show them that he knew more of the
      matter than they did; that he was no mere book-man; but on this unlucky
      day, all went wrong. It happened that Horace fell into some grievous error
      concerning the genealogy of a famous race-horse, and, disconcerted more
      than he would have been at being convicted of any degree of moral
      turpitude, vexed and ashamed, he talked no more of Newmarket or of
      Doncaster, left the race-ground to those who prided themselves on the
      excellences of their four-footed betters, and lounged into the
      billiard-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found Lady Cecilia playing with Beauclerc; Miss Stanley was looking on.
      Churchill was a famous billiard-player, and took his turn to show how much
      better than Beauclerc he performed, but this day his hand was out, his eye
      not good; he committed blunders of which a novice might have been ashamed.
      And there was Miss Stanley and there was Beauclerc by to see! and
      Beauclerc pitied him!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">  O line extreme of human misery!<br /></pre>
    <p>
      He retreated to the book-room, but there the intellectual Horace, with all
      the sages, poets, and novelists of every age within his reach, reached
      them not; but, with his hands in his pockets, like any squire or schoolboy
      under the load of ignorance or penalties of idleness, stood before the
      chimney-piece, eyeing the pendule, and verily believing that this morning
      the hands went backward. Dressing-time at last came, and dinner-time,
      bringing relief how often to man and child ill-tempered; but, this day to
      Churchill dinner brought only discomfiture worse discomfited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the neighbouring families were to dine at Clarendon Park. Mr.
      Churchill abhorred country neighbours and country gentlemen. Among these,
      however, were some not unworthy to be perceived by him; and besides these,
      there were some foreign officers; one in particular, from Spain, of high
      rank and birth, of the <i>sangre azul</i>, the <i>blue blood</i>, who have
      the privilege of the silken cord if they should come to be hanged. This
      Spaniard was a man of distinguished talent, and for him Horace might have
      been expected to shine out; it was his pleasure, however, this day to
      disappoint expectations, and to do &ldquo;the dishonours of his country.&rdquo; He
      would talk only of eating, of which he was privileged not only to speak
      but to judge, and pronounce upon <i>en dernier ressort</i>, though this
      was only an air, for he was not really a gourmand; but after ogling
      through his glass the distant dishes, when they with a wish came nigh, he,
      after a cursory glance or a close inspection, made them with a nod retire.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he thought an opportunity offered for bringing in a well-prepared
      anecdote which he had about Cambaçeres, and a hot blackbird and white
      feet, but unluckily a country gentleman would tell some history of a
      battle between poachers and gamekeepers, which fixed the attention of the
      company till the moment for the anecdote was past.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace left his tale untold, and spoke word never more till a subject was
      started on which he thought he could come out unrivalled. General
      Clarendon had some remarkably good wines. Churchill was referred to as a
      judge, and he allowed them to be all good, but he prided himself on
      possessing a certain Spanish wine, esteemed above all price, because not
      to be had for money&mdash;<i>amontillado</i> is its name. Horace appealed
      to the Spanish officer, who confirmed all he said of this vinous
      phenomenon. &ldquo;No cultivator can be certain of producing it. It has puzzled,
      almost to death, all the <i>growers</i> of Xeres:&mdash;it is a variety of
      sherry, almost as difficult to judge of as to procure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Churchill boasted he had some, undoubtedly genuine; he added,
      &ldquo;that Spanish judges had assured him his taste was so accurate he might
      venture to pronounce upon the difficult question of amontillado or not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While he yet spoke, General Clarendon, unawares, placed before him some of
      this very fine wine, which, as he finished speaking, Churchill swallowed
      without knowing it from some other sherry which he had been drinking. He
      would have questioned that it was genuine, but the Spaniard, as far as he
      could pretend to judge, thought it unquestionable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Churchill&rsquo;s countenance fell in a manner that quite surprised Helen, and
      exceedingly amused Lady Cecilia. He was more mortified and vexed by this
      failure than by all the rest, for the whole table smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening of this day of misfortune was not brighter than the morning,
      everything was wrong&mdash;even at night&mdash;at night when at last the
      dinner company, the country visitors, relieved him from their presence,
      and when some comfort might be had, he thought, stretched in a good
      easy-chair&mdash;Lord Davenant had set him the example. But something had
      happened to all the chairs,&mdash;there was a variety of fashionable
      kinds; he tried them by turns, but none of them this night would suit him.
      Yet Lady Cecilia maintained (for the general had chosen them) that they
      were each and all of them in their way comfortable, in the full English
      spirit of the word, and according to the French explanation of <i>comfortable</i>,
      given to us by the Duchess d&rsquo;Abrantes, <i>convenablement bon</i>; but in
      compassion to Mr. Churchill&rsquo;s fastidious restlessness, she would now show
      him a perfection of a chair which she had just had made for her own
      boudoir. She ordered that it should be brought, and in it rolled, and it
      was looked at in every direction and sat in, and no fault could be found
      with it, even by the great faultfinder; but what was it called? It was
      neither a lounger, nor a dormeuse, nor a Cooper, nor a Nelson, nor a
      kangaroo: a chair without a name would never do; in all things fashionable
      the name is more than half. Such a happy name as kangaroo Lady Cecilia
      despaired of finding for her new favourite, but she begged some one would
      give it a good one; whoever gave her the best name should be invited to
      the honours and pleasures of the sitting in this chair for the rest of the
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes, and all eyes, turned upon Mr. Churchill, but whether the
      occasion was too great, or that his desire to satisfy the raised
      expectation of the public was too high strained, or that the time was out
      of joint, or that he was out of sorts, the fact was, he could find no
      name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauclerc, who had not yet tried the chair, sank into its luxurious depth,
      and leaning back, asked if it might not be appropriately called the
      &ldquo;Sleepy-hollow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sleepy-hollow!&rdquo; repeated Lady Cecilia, &ldquo;excellent!&rdquo; and by acclamation
      &ldquo;Sleepy-hollow&rdquo; was approved; but when Beauclerc was invited to the
      honours of the sitting, he declined, declaring that the name was not his
      invention, only his recollection; it had been given by a friend of his to
      some such easy chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      This magnanimity was too much for Horace; he looked at his watch, found it
      was bed-time, pushed the chair out of his way, and departed; Beauclerc,
      the first and last idea in this his day of mortifications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing a man subject to these petty irritations lowers him in the eyes of
      woman. For that susceptibility of temper arising from the jealousy of
      love, even when excited by trifles, woman makes all reasonable, all
      natural allowance; but for the jealousy of self-love she has no pity.
      Unsuited to the manly character!&mdash;so Helen thought, and so every
      woman thinks.

    </h2>
    <p>
      It was expected by all who had witnessed his discomfiture and his parting
      push to the chair, that Mr. Churchill would be off early in the morning&mdash;such
      was his wont when he was disturbed in vanity: but he reappeared at
      breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      This day was a good day with Horace; he determined it should be so, and
      though it was again a wet day, he now showed that he could rule the
      weather of his own humour, when intensity of will was wakened by rivalry.
      He made himself most agreeable, and the man of yesterday was forgotten or
      remembered only as a foil to the man of to-day. The words he so much loved
      to hear, and to which he had so often surreptitiously listened, were now
      repeated, &lsquo;No one can be so agreeable as Horace Churchill is on his good
      days!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Bright he shone out, all gaiety and graciousness; the <i>cachet de faveur</i>
      was for all, but its finest impression was for Helen. He tried flattery,
      and wit, each playing on the other with reflected and reflecting lustre,
      for a woman naturally says to herself, &ldquo;When this man has so much wit, his
      flattery even must be worth something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And another day came, and another, and another party of friends filled the
      house, and still Mr. Churchill remained, and was now the delight of all.
      As far as concerned his successes in society, no one was more ready to
      join in applause than Beauclerc; but when Helen was in question he was
      different, though he had reasoned himself into the belief that he could
      not yet love Miss Stanley, therefore he could not be jealous. But he had
      been glad to observe that she had from the first seemed to see what sort
      of a person Mr. Churchill was. She was now only amused, as everybody must
      be, but she would never be interested by such a man as Horace Churchill, a
      wit without a soul. If she were&mdash;why he could never feel any further
      interest about her&mdash;that was all!
    </p>
    <p>
      So it went on; and now Lady Cecilia was as much amused as she expected by
      these daily jealousies, conflicts, and comparisons, the feelings
      perpetually tricking themselves out, and strutting about, calling
      themselves judgments, like the servants in Gil Blas in their masters&rsquo; 
      clothes, going about as counts dukes, and grandees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, really,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia to Helen, one day, as she was standing
      near her tambour frame, &ldquo;you are an industrious creature, and the only
      very industrious person I ever could bear. I have myself a natural
      aversion to a needle, but that tambour needle I can better endure than a
      common one, because, in the first place, it makes a little noise in the
      world; one not only sees but hears it getting on; one finds, that without
      dragging it draws at every link a lengthened chain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is called chainstitch, is it not?&rdquo; said the aide-de-camp; &ldquo;and Miss
      Stanley is working on so famously fast at it she will have us all in her
      chains by and by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bow, Miss Stanley,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia; &ldquo;that pretty compliment deserves
      at least a bow, if not a look-up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should prefer a look-down, if I were to choose,&rdquo; said Churchill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beggars must not be choosers,&rdquo; said the aide-de-camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the very reason I can bear to look at you working, Helen,&rdquo; continued
      Lady Cecilia, &ldquo;is, because you do look up so often&mdash;so refreshingly.
      The professed <i>Notables</i> I detest&mdash;those who never raise their
      eyes from their everlasting work; whatever is said, read, thought, or
      felt, is with them of secondary importance to that bit of muslin in which
      they are making holes, or that bit of canvass on which they are
      perpetrating such figures or flowers as nature scorns to look upon. I did
      not mean anything against you mamma, I assure you,&rdquo; continued Cecilia,
      turning to her mother, who was also at her embroidering frame, &ldquo;because,
      though you do work, or have work before you, to do you justice, you never
      attend to it in the least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you! my dear Cecilia,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant, smiling; &ldquo;I am, indeed,
      a sad bungler, but still I shall always maintain a great respect for work
      and workers, and I have good reasons for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so have I,&rdquo; said Lord Davenant. &ldquo;I only wish that men who do not know
      what to do with their hands, were not ashamed to sew. If custom had but
      allowed us this resource, how many valuable lives might have been saved,
      how many rich ennuyés would not have hung themselves, even in November!
      What years of war, what overthrow of empires, might have been avoided, if
      princes and sultans, instead of throwing handkerchiefs, had but hemmed
      them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant, &ldquo;recollect that the race of Spanish kings
      has somewhat deteriorated since they exchanged the sword for the
      tambour-frame. We had better have things as they are: leave us the
      privilege of the needle, and what a valuable resource it is; sovereign
      against the root of all evil&mdash;an antidote both to love in idleness
      and hate in idleness&mdash;which is most to be dreaded, let those who have
      felt both decide. I think we ladies must be allowed to keep the privilege
      of the needle to ourselves, humble though it be, for we must allow it is a
      good one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good at need,&rdquo; said Churchill. &ldquo;There is an excellent print, by Bouck, I
      believe, of an old woman beating the devil with a distaff; distaffs have
      been out of fashion with spinsters ever since, I fancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But as she was old, Churchill,&rdquo; said Lord Davenant, &ldquo;might not your lady
      have defied his black majesty, without her distaff?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His <i>black</i> majesty! I admire your distinction, my lord,&rdquo; said
      Churchill, &ldquo;but give it more emphasis; for all kings are not black in the
      eyes of the fair, it is said, you know.&rdquo; And here he began an anecdote of
      regal scandal in which Lady Cecilia stopped him&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Horace, I protest against your beginning with scandal so early in
      the morning. None of your <i>on dits</i>, for decency&rsquo;s sake, before
      luncheon; wait till evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Churchill coughed, and shrugged, and sighed, and declared he would be
      temperate; he would not touch a character, upon his honour; he would only
      indulge in a few little personalities; it could not hurt any lady&rsquo;s
      feelings that he should criticise or praise absent beauties. So he just
      made a review of all he could recollect, in answer to a question one of
      the officers, Captain Warmsley, had asked him, and which, in an absent
      fit, he had had the ill-manners yesterday, as now he recollected, not to
      answer&mdash;Whom he considered as altogether the handsomest woman of his
      acquaintance? Beauclerc was now in the room, and Horace was proud to
      display, before him in particular, his infinite knowledge of all the fair
      and fashionable, and all that might be admitted fashionable without being
      fair&mdash;all that have the <i>je ne sais quoi</i>, which is than beauty
      dearer. As one conscious of his power to consecrate or desecrate, by one
      look of disdain or one word of praise, he stood; and beginning at the
      lowest conceivable point, his uttermost notion of want of beauty&mdash;his
      <i>laid ideal</i>, naming one whose image, no doubt, every charitable
      imagination will here supply, Horace next fixed upon another for his
      mediocrity point&mdash;what he should call &ldquo;just well enough&rdquo;&mdash;<i>assez
      bien, assez</i>&mdash;just up to the Bellasis motto, &ldquo;<i>Bonne et belle
      assez</i>.&rdquo; Then, in the ascending scale, he rose to those who, in common
      parlance, may be called charming, fascinating; and still for each he had
      his fastidious look and depreciating word. Just keeping within the verge,
      Horace, without exposing himself to the ridicule of coxcombry, ended by
      sighing for that being &lsquo;made of every creature&rsquo;s best&rsquo;&mdash;perfect, yet
      free from the curse of perfection. Then, suddenly turning to Beauclerc,
      and tapping him on the shoulder&mdash;&ldquo;Do, give us your notions&mdash;to
      what sort of a body or mind, now, would you willingly bend the knee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beauclerc could not or would not tell&mdash;&ldquo;I only know that whenever I
      bend the knee,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it will be because I cannot help it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beauclerc could not be drawn out either by Churchill&rsquo;s persiflage or
      flattery, and he tried both, to talk of his tastes or opinions of women.
      He felt too much perhaps about love to talk much about it. This all agreed
      well in Helen&rsquo;s imagination with what Lady Cecilia had told her of his
      secret engagement. She was sure he was thinking of Lady Blanche, and that
      he could not venture to describe her, lest he should betray himself and
      his secret. Then, leaving Churchill and the talkers, he walked up and down
      the room alone, at the further side, seeming as if he were recollecting
      some lines which he repeated to himself, and then stopping before Lady
      Cecilia, repeated to her, in a very low voice, the following:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">  &ldquo;I saw her upon nearer view,<br />  A spirit, yet a woman too!<br />  Her household motions light and free,<br />  And steps of virgin liberty;<br />  A countenance in which did meet<br />  Sweet records, promises as sweet;<br />  A creature not too bright or good<br />  For human nature&rsquo;s daily food;<br />  For transient sorrows, simple wiles,<br />  Praise, blame, love, kisses, tears, and smiles."<br /></pre>
    <p>
      Helen thought Lady Blanche must be a charming creature if she was like
      this picture; but somehow, as she afterwards told Lady Cecilia, she had
      formed a different idea of Lady Blanche Forrester&mdash;Cecilia smiled and
      asked, &ldquo;How? different how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen did not exactly know, but altogether she had imagined that she must
      be more of a heroine, or perhaps more of a woman of rank and fashion. She
      had not formed any exact idea&mdash;but different altogether from this
      description. Lady Cecilia again smiled, and said, &ldquo;Very natural; and after
      all not very certain that the Lady Blanche is like this picture, which was
      not drawn for her or from her assuredly&mdash;a resemblance found only in
      the imagination, to which we are, all of us, more or less, dupes; and <i>tant
      mieux</i> say I&mdash;<i>tant pis</i> says mamma&mdash;and all mothers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one thing I like better in Mr. Beauclerc&rsquo;s manners than in Mr.
      Churchill,&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are a hundred I like better,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia, &ldquo;but what is your
      one thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he always speaks of women in general with respect&mdash;as if he had
      more confidence in them, and more dependence upon them for his happiness.
      Now Mr. Churchill, with all the adoration he professes, seems to look upon
      them as idols that he can set up or pull down, bend the knee to or break
      to pieces, at pleasure&mdash;I could not like a man for a friend who had a
      bad, or even a contemptuous, opinion of women&mdash;could you, Cecilia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; Lady Cecilia said; &ldquo;the general had always, naturally,
      the greatest respect for women. Whatever prejudices he had taken up had
      been only caught from others, and lasted only till he had got rid of the
      impression of certain &lsquo;untoward circumstances.&rsquo;&rdquo; Even a grave, serious
      dislike, both Lady Cecilia and Helen agreed that they could bear better
      than that persiflage which seemed to mock even while it most professed to
      admire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace presently discovered the mistakes he had made in his attempts, and
      repaired them as fast as he could by his infinite versatility. The changes
      shaded off with a skill which made them run easily into each other. He
      perceived that Mr. Beauclerc&rsquo;s respectful air and tone were preferred, and
      he now laid himself out in the respectful line, adding, as he flattered
      himself, something of a finer point, more polish in whatever he said, and
      with more weight of authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was mortified to find that it did not produce the expected effect,
      and, after having done the respectful one morning, as he fancied, in the
      happiest manner, he was vexed to perceive that he not only could not raise
      Helen&rsquo;s eyes from her work, but that even Lady Davenant did not attend to
      him: and that, as he was rounding one of his best periods, her looks were
      directed to the other side of the room, where Beauclerc sat apart; and
      presently she called to him, and begged to know what it was he was
      reading. She said she quite envied him the power he possessed of being
      rapt into future times or past, completely at his author&rsquo;s bidding, to be
      transported how and where he pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauclerc brought the book to her, and put it into her hand. As she took
      it she said, &ldquo;As we advance in life, it becomes more and more difficult to
      find in any book the sort of enchanting, entrancing interest which we
      enjoyed when life, and, books, and we ourselves were new. It were vain to
      try and settle whether the fault is most in modern books, or in our
      ancient selves; probably not in either: the fact is, that not only does
      the imagination cool and weaken as we grow older, but we become, as we
      live on in this world, too much engrossed by the real business and cares
      of life, to have feeling or time for factitious, imaginary interests. But
      why do I say factitious? while they last, the imaginative interests are as
      real as any others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Beauclerc, &ldquo;for doing justice to poor imagination, whose
      pleasures are surely, after all, the highest, the most real, that we have,
      unwarrantably as they have been decried both by metaphysicians and
      physicians.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The book which had so fixed Beauclerc&rsquo;s attention, was Segur&rsquo;s History of
      Napoleon&rsquo;s Russian Campaign. He was at the page where the burning of
      Moscow is described&mdash;the picture of Buonaparte&rsquo;s despair, when he met
      resolution greater than his own, when he felt himself vanquished by the
      human mind, by patriotism, by virtue&mdash;virtue in which he could not
      believe, the existence of which, with all his imagination, he could not
      conceive: the power which his indomitable will could not conquer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauclerc pointed to the account of that famous inscription on the iron
      gate of a church which the French found still standing, the words written
      by Rostopchin after the burning of his &ldquo;delightful home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Frenchmen, I have been eight years in embellishing this residence; I
      have lived in it happily in the bosom of my family. The inhabitants of
      this estate (amounting to seventeen hundred and twenty) have quitted it at
      your approach; and I have, with my own hands, set fire to my own house, to
      prevent it from being polluted by your presence.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See what one, even one, magnanimous individual can do for his country,&rdquo;
       exclaimed Beauclerc. &ldquo;How little did this sacrifice cost him! Sacrifice do
      I say? it was a pride&mdash;a pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Churchill did not at all like the expression of Helen&rsquo;s countenance, for
      he perceived she sympathised with Beauclerc&rsquo;s enthusiasm. He saw that
      romantic enthusiasm had more charm for her than wit or fashion; and now he
      meditated another change of style. He would try a noble style. He resolved
      that the first convenient opportunity he would be a little romantic, and
      perhaps, even take a touch at chivalry, a burst like Beauclerc, but in a
      way of his own, at the degeneracy of modern times. He tried it&mdash;but
      it was quite a failure; Lady Cecilia, as he overheard, whispered to Helen
      what was once so happily said&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Ah! le pauvre homme! comme il se
      batte les flancs d&rsquo;un enthousiasme de commande.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace was too clever a man to persist in a wrong line, or one in which
      his test of right <i>success</i> did not crown his endeavours. If this did
      not do, something else would&mdash;should. It was impossible that with all
      his spirit of resource he should ultimately fail. To please, and to make
      an impression on Helen, a greater impression than Beauclerc&mdash;to annoy
      Beauclerc, in short, was still, independently of all serious thoughts, the
      utmost object of Churchill&rsquo;s endeavours.

      CHAPTER I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      About this time a circumstance occurred, which seemed to have nothing to
      do with Churchill, or Beauclerc, but which eventually brought both their
      characters into action and passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Davenant had purchased, at the sale of Dean Stanley&rsquo;s pictures,
      several of those which had been the dean&rsquo;s favourites, and which,
      independently of their positive merit, were peculiarly dear to Helen. He
      had ordered that they should be sent down to Clarendon Park; at first, he
      only begged house-room for them from the general while he and Lady
      Davenant were in Russia; then he said that in case he should never return
      he wished the pictures should be divided between his two dear children,
      Cecilia and Helen; and that, to prevent disputes, he would make the
      distribution of them himself now, and in the kindest and most playful
      manner he allotted them to each, always finding some excellent reason for
      giving to Helen those which he knew she liked best; and then there was to
      be a <i>hanging committee</i>, for hanging the pictures, which occasioned
      a great deal of talking, Beauclerc always thinking most of Helen, or of
      what was really best for the paintings; Horace most of himself and his
      amateurship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among these pictures were some fine Wouvermans, and other hunting and
      hawking pieces, and one in particular of the duchess and her ladies, from
      Don Quixote. Beauclerc, who had gone round examining and admiring, stood
      fixed when he came to this picture, in which he fancied he discovered in
      one of the figures some likeness to Helen; the lady had a hawk upon her
      wrist. Churchill came up eagerly to the examination, with glass at eye. He
      could not discern the slightest resemblance to Miss Stanley; but he was in
      haste to bring out an excellent observation of his own, which he had made
      his own from a Quarterly Review, illustrating the advantage it would be to
      painters to possess knowledge, even of kinds seemingly most distant from
      the line of their profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For instance, now <i>à priori</i>, one should not insist upon a great
      painter&rsquo;s being a good ornithologist, and yet, for want of being something
      of a bird-fancier, look here what he has done&mdash;quite absurd, a sort
      of hawk introduced, such as never was or could be at any hawking affair in
      nature: would not sit upon lady&rsquo;s wrist or answer to her call&mdash;would
      never fly at a bird. Now you see this is a ridiculous blunder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Churchill plumed himself on this critical remark Captain Warmsley
      told of who still kept hawks in England, and of the hawking parties he had
      seen and heard of&mdash;&ldquo;even this year, that famous hawking in Wiltshire,
      and that other in Norfolk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Churchill asked Warmsley if he had been at Lord Berner&rsquo;s when Landseer was
      there studying the subject of his famous hawking scene. &ldquo;Have you seen it,
      Lady Cecilia?&rdquo; continued he; &ldquo;it is beautiful; the birds seem to be
      absolutely coming out of the picture;&rdquo; and he was going on with some of
      his connoisseurship, and telling of his mortification in having missed the
      purchase of that picture; but Warmsley got back to the hawking he had
      seen, and he became absolutely eloquent in describing the sport.
    </p>
    <p>
      Churchill, though eager to speak, listened with tolerably polite patience
      till Warmsley came to what he had forgot to mention,&mdash;to the label
      with the date of place and year that is put upon the heron&rsquo;s leg; to the
      heron brought from Denmark, where it had been caught, with the label of
      having been let fly from Lord Berner&rsquo;s; &ldquo;for,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;the heron is
      always to be saved if possible, so, when it is down, and the hawk over it,
      the falconer has some raw beef ready minced, and lays it on the heron&rsquo;s
      back, or a pigeon, just killed, is sometimes used; the hawk devours it,
      and the heron, quite safe, as soon as it recovers from its fright, mounts
      slowly upward and returns to its heronry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen listened eagerly, and so did Lady Cecilia, who said, &ldquo;You know,
      Helen, our favourite Washington Irving quotes that in days of yore, &lsquo;a
      lady of rank did not think herself completely equipped in riding forth,
      unless she had her tassel-gentel held by jesses on her delicate hand.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before her words were well finished, Beauclerc had decided what he would
      do, and the business was half done that is well begun. He was at the
      library table, writing as fast as pen could go, to give carte blanche to a
      friend, to secure for him immediately a whole hawking establishment which
      Warmsley had mentioned, and which was now upon public sale, or privately
      to be parted with by the present possessor.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the very moment when Beauclerc was signing and sealing at one end of
      the room, at the other Horace Churchill, to whom something of the same
      plan had occurred, was charming Lady Cecilia Clarendon, by hinting to her
      his scheme&mdash;anticipating the honour of seeing one of his hawks borne
      upon her delicate wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauclerc, after despatching his letter, came up just in time to catch the
      sound and the sense, and took Horace aside to tell him what he had done.
      Horace looked vexed, and haughtily observed, that he conceived his place
      at Erlesmede was better calculated for a hawking party than most places in
      England; and he had already announced his intentions to the ladies. The
      way was open to him&mdash;but Beauclerc did not see why he should recede;
      the same post might carry both their letters&mdash;both their orders!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How far did your order go, may I ask?&rdquo; said Churchill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carte blanche.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Churchill owned, with a sarcastic smile, that he was not prepared to go
      quite so far. He was not quite so young as Granville; he, unfortunately,
      had arrived at years of discretion&mdash;he said unfortunately; without
      ironical reservation, he protested from the bottom of his heart he
      considered it as a misfortune to have become that slow circumspect sort of
      creature which looks before it leaps. Even though this might save him from
      the fate of the man who was in Sicily, still he considered it as
      unfortunate to have lost so much of his natural enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Natural enthusiasm!&rdquo; Beauclerc could not help repeating to himself, and
      he went on his own way. It must be confessed, as even Beauclerc&rsquo;s best
      friends allowed, counting among them Lady Davenant and his guardian, that
      never was man of sense more subject to that kind of temporary derangement
      of the reasoning powers which results from being what is called bit by a
      fancy; he would then run on straight forward, without looking to the right
      or the left, in pursuit of his object, great or small. That hawking
      establishment now in view, completely shut out, for the moment, all other
      objects; &ldquo;of tercels and of lures he talks;&rdquo; and before his imagination
      were hawking scenes, and Helen with a hawk on her wrist, looking most
      graceful&mdash;a hawk of his own training it should be. Then, how to train
      a hawk became the question. While he was waiting for the answer to his
      carte blanche, nothing better, or so good, could be done, as to make
      himself master of the whole business, and for this purpose he found it
      essential to consult every book on falconry that could be found in the
      library, and a great plague he became to everybody in the course of this
      book-hunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a bore!&rdquo; Warmsley might be excused for muttering deep and low
      between the teeth. General Clarendon sighed and groaned. Lady Davenant
      bore and forebore philosophically&mdash;it was for Beauclerc; and to her
      great philosophy she gave all the credit of her indulgent partiality. Lady
      Cecilia, half-annoyed yet ever good-natured, carried her complaisance so
      far as to consult the catalogue and book-shelves sundry times in one hour;
      but she was not famous for patience, and she soon resigned him to a better
      friend&mdash;Helen, the most indefatigable of book-hunters. She had been
      well trained to it by her uncle; had been used to it all her life; and
      really took pleasure in the tiresome business. She assured Beauclerc it
      was not the least trouble, and he thought she looked beautiful when she
      said so. Whosoever of the male kind, young, and of ardent, not to say
      impatient, spirit, has ever been aided and abetted in a sudden whim,
      assisted, forwarded, above all, sympathised with, through all the changes
      and chances of a reigning fancy, may possibly conceive how charming, and
      more charming every hour, perhaps minute, Helen became in Beauclerc&rsquo;s
      eyes. But, all in the way of friendship observe. Perfectly so&mdash;on her
      part, for she could not have another idea, and it was for this reason she
      was so much at her ease. He so understood it, and, thoroughly a gentleman,
      free from coxcombry, as he was, and interpreting the language and manners
      of women with instinctive delicacy, they went on delightfully. Churchill
      was on the watch, but he was not alarmed; all was so undisguised and
      frank, that now he began to feel assured that love on her side not only
      was, but ever would be, quite out of the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauclerc was, indeed, in the present instance, really and truly intent
      upon what he was about; and he pursued the History of Falconry, with all
      its episodes, from the olden time of the Boke of St. Alban&rsquo;s down to the
      last number of the Sporting Magazine, including Colonel Thornton&rsquo;s latest
      flight, with the adventures of his red falcons, Miss M&rsquo;Ghee and Lord
      Townsend, and his red tercels, Messrs. Croc Franc and Craignon;&mdash;not
      forgetting that never-to-be forgotten hawking of the Emperor
      Arambombamboberus with Trebizonian eagles, on the authority of a
      manuscript in the Grand Signior&rsquo;s library.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauclerc had such extraordinary dependence upon the sympathy of his
      friends, that, when he was reading any thing that interested him, no
      matter what they might be doing, he must have their admiration for what
      charmed him. He brought his book to Lord Davenant, who was writing a
      letter. &ldquo;Listen, oh listen! to this pathetic lament of the falconer,&mdash;&lsquo;Hawks,
      heretofore the pride of royalty, the insignia of nobility, the
      ambassador&rsquo;s present, the priest&rsquo;s indulgence, companion of the knight,
      and nursling of the gentle mistress, are now uncalled-for and neglected.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! very well that,&rdquo; said good-natured Lord Davenant, stopping his pen,
      dipping again, dotting, and going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Beauclerc passaged to Lady Davenant, and, interrupting her in Scott&rsquo;s
      Lives of the Novelists, on which she was deeply intent, &ldquo;Allow me, my dear
      Lady Davenant, though you say you are no great topographer, to show you
      this, it is so curious; this royal falconer&rsquo;s proclamation&mdash;Henry the
      Eighth&rsquo;s&mdash;to preserve his partridges, pheasants, and herons, from his
      palace at Westminster to St. Giles&rsquo;s <i>in the Fields</i>, and from thence
      to Islington, Hampstead, and Highgate, under penalty for every bird killed
      of imprisonment, or whatever other punishment to his highness may seem
      meet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Davenant vouchsafed some suitable remark, consonant to expectation,
      on the changes of times and places, and men and manners, and then motioned
      the quarto away with which motion the quarto reluctantly complied; and
      then following Lady Cecilia from window to window, as she <i>tended</i>
      her flowers, he would insist upon her hearing the table of precedence for
      hawks. She, who never cared for any table of precedence in her life, even
      where the higher animals were concerned, would only undertake to remember
      that the merlin was a lady&rsquo;s hawk, and this only upon condition, that she
      should have one to sit upon her wrist like the fair ladies in Wouvermans&rsquo; 
      pictures. But further, as to Peregrine, Gerfalcon, or Gerkin, she would
      hear nought of them, nor could she listen, though Granville earnestly
      exhorted, to the several good reasons which make a falcon dislike her
      master&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      1st. If he speak rudely to her. 2nd. If he feed her carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he could get thirdly out, Lady Cecilia stopped him, declaring that
      in all her life she never could listen to any thing that began with <i>first</i>
      and <i>secondly</i>&mdash;reasons especially.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace, meanwhile, looked superior down, and thought with ineffable
      contempt of Beauclerc&rsquo;s little skill in the arts of conversation, thus
      upon unwilling ears to squander anecdotes which would have done him credit
      at some London dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I could have made of them! and may make of them yet,&rdquo; thought he;
      &ldquo;but some there are, who never can contrive, as other some cleverly do, to
      ride their hobby-horses to good purpose and good effect;&mdash;now
      Beauclerc&rsquo;s hobbies, I plainly see, will always run away with him
      headlong, cost him dear certainly, and, may be, leave him in the mire at
      last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What this fancy was to cost him, Beauclerc did not yet know. Two or three
      passages in the Sporting Magazine had given some hints of the expense of
      this &ldquo;most delectable of all country contentments,&rdquo; which he had not
      thought it necessary to read aloud. And he knew that the late Lord Orford,
      an ardent pursuer of this &ldquo;royal and noble&rdquo; sport, had expended one
      hundred a-year on every hawk he kept, each requiring a separate attendant,
      and being moreover indulged in an excursion to the Continent every season
      during moulting-time: but Beauclerc said to himself he had no notion of
      humouring his hawks to that degree; they should, aristocratic birds though
      they be, content themselves in England, and not pretend to &ldquo;damn the
      climate like a lord.&rdquo; And he flattered himself that he should be able to
      pursue his fancy more cheaply than any of his predecessors; but as he had
      promised his guardian that, after the indulgence granted him in the
      Beltravers&rsquo; cause, he would not call upon him for any more extraordinary
      supplies, he resolved, in case the expense exceeded his ways and means, to
      sell his hunters, and so indulge in a new love at the expense of an old
      one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The expected pleasure of the first day&rsquo;s hawking was now bright in his
      imagination; the day was named, the weather promised well, and the German
      cadgers and trainers who had been engaged, and who, along with the whole
      establishment, were handed over to Beauclerc, were to come down to
      Clarendon Park, and Beauclerc was very happy teaching the merlins to sit
      on Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s and on Miss Stanley&rsquo;s wrist. Helen&rsquo;s voice was found to
      be peculiarly agreeable to the hawk, who, as Beauclerc observed, loved,
      like Lear, that excellent thing in woman, a voice ever soft, gentle, and
      low.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies were to wear some pretty dresses for the occasion, and all was
      gaiety and expectation; and Churchill was mortified when he saw how well
      the thing was likely to take, that he was not to be the giver of the fête,
      especially as he observed that Helen was particularly pleased&mdash;when,
      to his inexpressible surprise, Granville Beauclerc came to him, a few days
      before that appointed for the hawking-party, and said that he had changed
      his mind, that he wished to get rid of the whole concern&mdash;that he
      should be really obliged to Churchill if he would take his engagement off
      his hands. The only reason he gave was, that the establishment would
      altogether be more than he could afford, he found he had other calls for
      money, which were incompatible with his fancy, and therefore he would give
      it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Churchill obliged him most willingly by taking the whole upon himself, and
      he managed so to do in a very ingenious way, without incurring any
      preposterous expense. He was acquainted with a set of rich, fashionable
      young men, who had taken a sporting lodge in a neighbouring county, who
      desired no better than to accede to the terms proposed, and to distinguish
      themselves by giving a fête out of the common line, while Churchill, who
      understood, like a true man of the world, the worldly art of bargaining,
      contrived, with off-hand gentleman-like jockeying, to have every point
      settled to his own convenience, and he was to be the giver of the
      entertainment to the ladies at Clarendon Park. When this change in affairs
      was announced, Lady Cecilia, the general, Lady Davenant, and Helen, were
      all, in various degrees, surprised, and each tried to guess what could
      have been the cause of Beauclerc&rsquo;s sudden relinquishment of his purpose.
      He was&mdash;very extraordinary for him&mdash;impenetrable: he adhered to
      the words &ldquo;I found I could not afford it.&rdquo; His guardian could not believe
      in this wonderful prudence, and was almost certain &ldquo;there must be some
      imprudence at the bottom of it all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Granville neither admitted nor repelled that accusation. Lady Cecilia
      worked away with perpetual little strokes, hoping to strike out the truth,
      but, as she said, you might as well have worked at an old flint. Nothing
      was elicited from him, even by Lady Davenant; nor did the collision of all
      their opinions throw any light upon the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the day for the hawking-party arrived. Churchill gave the fete,
      and Beauclerc, as one of the guests, attended and enjoyed it without the
      least appearance even of disappointment; and, so far from envying
      Churchill, he assisted in remedying any little defects, and did all he
      could to make the whole go off well.
    </p>
    <p>
      The party assembled on a rising ground; a flag was displayed to give
      notice of the intended sport; the falconers appeared, picturesque figures
      in their green jackets and their long gloves, and their caps plumed with
      herons&rsquo; feathers&mdash;some with the birds on their wrists&mdash;one with
      the frame over his shoulder upon which to set the hawk. <i>Set</i>, did we
      say?&mdash;no: &ldquo;<i>cast</i> your hawk on the perch&rdquo; is, Beauclerc
      observed, the correct term; for, as Horace sarcastically remarked, Mr.
      Beauclerc might be detected as a novice in the art by his over-exactness;
      his too correct, too attic, pronunciation of the hawking language. But
      Granville readily and gaily bore all this ridicule and raillery, sure that
      it would neither stick nor stain, enjoying with all his heart the
      amusement of the scene&mdash;the assembled ladies, the attendant
      cavaliers; the hood-winked hawks, the ringing of their brass bells; the
      falconers anxiously watching the clouds for the first appearance of the
      bird; their skill in loosening the hoods, as, having but one hand at
      liberty, they used their teeth to untie the string:&mdash;&mdash;And now
      the hoods are off, and the hawks let fly.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were to fly many castes of hawks this day; the first flight was after
      a curlew; and the riding was so hard, so dangerous, from the broken nature
      of the ground, that the ladies gave it up, and were contented to view the
      sport from the eminence where they remained.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now there was a question to be decided among the sportsmen as to the
      comparative rate of riding at a fox chase, and in &ldquo;the short, but
      terrifically hard gallop, with the eyes raised to the clouds, which is
      necessary for the full enjoyment of hawking;&rdquo; and then the gentlemen,
      returning, gathered round the ladies, and the settling the point, watches
      in hand, and bets depending, added to the interest of flight the first,
      and Churchill, master of the revels, was in the highest spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      But presently the sky was overcast, the morning lowered, the wind rose,
      and changed was Churchill&rsquo;s brow; there is no such thing as hawking
      against the wind&mdash;that capricious wind!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curse the wind!&rdquo; cried Churchill; &ldquo;and confusion seize the fellow who
      says there is to be no more hawking to-day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chief falconer, however, was a phlegmatic German, and proper-behaved,
      as good falconers should be, who, as &ldquo;Old Tristram&rsquo;s booke&rdquo; has it, even
      if a bird should be lost, he should never swear, and only say, &ldquo;<i>Dieu
      soit loué</i>,&rdquo; and &ldquo;remember that the mother of hawks is not dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Horace, in the face of reason and in defiance of his German
      counsellors, insisted upon letting fly the hawks in this high wind; and it
      so fell out that, in the first place, all the terms he used in his haste
      and spleen were wrong; and in the next, that the quarry taking down the
      wind, the horsemen could not keep up with the hawks: the falconers in
      great alarm, called to them by the names they gave them&mdash;&ldquo;Miss
      Didlington,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lord Berners.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ha! Miss Didlington&rsquo;s off;&mdash;off with
      Blucher, and Lady Kirby, and Lord Berners, and all of &lsquo;em after her.&rdquo; Miss
      Didlington flew fast and far, and further still, till she and all the rest
      were fairly out of sight&mdash;lost, lost, lost!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as fine a caste of hawks they were as ever came from Germany!&rdquo;&mdash;the
      falconers were in despair, and Churchill saw that the fault was his; and
      it looked so like cockney sportsmanship! If Horace had been in a towering
      rage, it would have been well enough; but he only grew pettish, snappish,
      waspish: now none of those words ending in <i>ish</i> become a gentleman;
      ladies always think so, and Lady Cecilia now thought so, and Helen thought
      so too, and Churchill saw it, and he grew pale instead of red, and that
      looks ugly in an angry man.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Beauclerc excused him when he was out of hearing; and when others said
      he had been cross, and crosser than became the giver of a gala, Beauclerc
      pleaded well for him, that falconry has ever been known to be &ldquo;an extreme
      stirrer-up of the passions, being subject to mischances infinite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However, a cold and hot collation under the trees for some, and under a
      tent for others, set all to rights for the present. Champagne sparkled,
      and Horace pledged and was pledged, and all were gay; even the Germans at
      their own table, after their own fashion, with their Rhenish and their
      foaming ale, contrived to drown the recollection of the sad adventure of
      the truant hawks.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when all were refreshed and renewed in mind and body, to the hawking
      they went again. For now that
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">  &ldquo;The wind was laid, and all their fears asleep,"<br /></pre>
    <p>
      there was to be a battle between heron and hawk, one of the finest sights
      that can be in all falconry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look! look! Miss Stanley,&rdquo; cried Granville; &ldquo;look! follow that high-flown
      hawk&mdash;that black speck in the clouds. Now! now! right over the heron;
      and now she will <i>canceleer</i>&mdash;turn on her wing, Miss Stanley, as
      she comes down, whirl round, and balance herself&mdash;<i>chanceler</i>.
      Now! now look! cancelleering gloriously!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Helen at this instant recollected what Captain Warmsley had said of
      the fresh-killed pigeon, which the falconer in the nick of time is to lay
      upon the heron&rsquo;s back; and now, even as the cancelleering was going on&mdash;three
      times most beautifully, Helen saw only the dove, the white dove, which
      that black-hearted German held, his great hand round the throat, just
      raised to wring it. &ldquo;Oh, Beauclerc, save it, save it!&rdquo; cried Lady Cecilia
      and Helen at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauclerc sprang forward, and, had it been a tiger instead of a dove,
      would have done the same no doubt at that moment; the dove was saved, and
      the heron killed. If Helen was pleased, so was not the chief falconer, nor
      any of the falconers, the whole German council in combustion! and Horace
      Churchill deeming it &ldquo;Rather extraordinary that any gentleman should so
      interfere with other gentlemen&rsquo;s hawks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia stepped between, and never stepped in vain. She drew a ring
      from her finger&mdash;a seal; it was the seal of peace&mdash;no great
      value&mdash;but a well-cut bird&mdash;a bird for the chief falconer&mdash;a
      guinea-hen, with its appropriate cry, its polite motto, &ldquo;Come back, come
      back;&rdquo; and she gave it as a pledge that the ladies would come back another
      day, and see another hawking; and the gentlemen were pleased, and the
      aggrieved attendant falconers pacified by a promise of another heron from
      the heronry at Clarendon Park; and the clouded faces brightened, and &ldquo;she
      smoothed the raven down of darkness till it smiled,&rdquo; whatever that may
      mean; but, as Milton said it, it must be sense as well as sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      At all events, in plain prose, be it understood that every body was
      satisfied, even Mr. Churchill; for Beauclerc had repaired for him, just in
      time, an error which would have been a blot on his gallantry of the day.
      He had forgotten to have some of the pretty grey hairs plucked from the
      heron, to give to the ladies to ornament their bonnets, but Beauclerc had
      secured them for him, and also two or three of those much-valued, smooth,
      black feathers, from the head of the bird, which are so much prized that a
      plume of them is often set with pearls and diamonds. Horace presented
      these most gracefully to Lady Cecilia and Helen, and was charmed with Lady
      Cecilia&rsquo;s parting compliments, which finished with the words &ldquo;Quite
      chivalrous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so, after all the changes and chances of weather, wind, and humour,
      all ended well, and no one rued the hawking of this day.

      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But all this time,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant, &ldquo;you have not told me whether you
      have any of you found out what changed Granville&rsquo;s mind about this
      falconry scheme&mdash;why he so suddenly gave up the whole to Mr.
      Churchill. Such a point-blank weathercock turn of fancy in most young men
      would no more surprise me than the changes of those clouds in the sky, now
      shaped and now unshaped by the driving wind; but in Granville Beauclerc
      there is always some reason for apparent caprice, and the reason is often
      so ingeniously wrong that it amuses me to hear it; and even as a study in
      human nature, I am curious to know the simple fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But no one could tell the simple fact, no one could guess his reason, and
      from him it never would have been known&mdash;never could have been found
      out, but from a mistake&mdash;from a letter of thanks coming to a wrong
      person.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, when Helen was sitting in Lady Davenant&rsquo;s room with her, Lord
      Davenant came in, reading a letter, like one walking in his sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is all this, my dear? Can you explain it to me? Some good action of
      yours, I suppose, for which I am to be thanked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Davenant looked at the letter. She had nothing to do with the matter,
      she said; but, on second thoughts, exclaimed, &ldquo;This is Granville
      Beauclerc&rsquo;s doing, I am clear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The letter was from Count Polianski, one of the poor banished Poles; now
      poor, but who had been formerly master of a property estimated at about
      one hundred and sixty-five thousand <i>available individuals</i>. In
      attempting to increase the happiness and secure the liberty of these
      available individuals, the count had lost every thing, and had been
      banished from his country&mdash;a man of high feeling as well as talents,
      and who had done all he could for that unhappy country, torn to pieces by
      demagogues from within and tyrants from without.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Davenant now recollected that Beauclerc had learned from her all
      this, and had heard her regretting that the circumstances in which Lord
      Davenant was placed at this moment, prevented the possibility of his
      affording this poor count assistance for numbers of his suffering
      fellow-countrymen who had been banished along with him, and who were now
      in London in the utmost distress. Lady Davenant remembered that she had
      been speaking to Granville on this subject the very day that he had
      abandoned his falconry project. &ldquo;Now I understand it all,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;and
      it is like all I know and all I have hoped of him. These hundreds a-year
      which he has settled on these wretched exiles, are rather better disposed
      of in a noble national cause, than in pampering one set of birds that they
      may fly at another set.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet this is done,&rdquo; said Lord Davenant, &ldquo;by one of the much reviled,
      high-bred English gentlemen&mdash;among whom, let the much reviling,
      low-bred English democrats say what they will, we find every day instances
      of subscription for public purposes from private benevolence, in a spirit
      of princely charity to be found only in our own dear England&mdash;England
      with all her faults.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this was a less ordinary sort of generosity of Granville&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said
      Lady Davenant,&mdash;&ldquo;the giving up a new pleasure, a new whim with all
      its gloss fresh upon it, full and bright in his eye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Lord Davenant; &ldquo;I never saw a strong-pulling fancy better
      thrown upon its haunches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The white dove, whose life Helen had saved, was brought home by Beauclerc,
      and was offered to her and accepted. Whether she had done a good or a bad
      action, by thus saving the life of a pigeon at the expense of a heron, may
      be doubted, and will be decided according to the several tastes of ladies
      and gentlemen for herons or doves. As Lady Davenant remarked, Helen&rsquo;s
      humanity (or dove-anity, as Churchill called it,) was of that equivocal
      sort which is ready to destroy one creature to save another which may
      happen to be a greater favourite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be this as it may, the favourite had a friend upon the present occasion,
      and no less a friend than General Clarendon, who presented it with a
      marble basin, such as doves should drink out of, by right of long
      prescription.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general feared, he said, &ldquo;that this vase might be a little too deep&mdash;dangerously
      perhaps&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Helen thought nothing could be altogether more perfect in taste and in
      kindness&mdash;approving Beauclerc&rsquo;s kindness too&mdash;a remembrance of a
      day most agreeably spent. Churchill, to whom she looked, as she said the
      last words, with all becoming politeness, bowed and accepted the
      compliment, but with a reserve of jealousy on the brow; and as he looked
      again at the dove, caressing and caressed, and then at the classic vase&mdash;he
      stood vexed, and to himself he said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So this is the end of all my pains&mdash;hawking and all &lsquo;quite
      chivalrous!&rsquo; Beauclerc carries off the honours and pleasures of the day,
      and his present and his dove are to be all in all. Yet still,&rdquo; continued
      he to himself in more consolatory thought&mdash;&ldquo;she is so open in her
      very love for the bird, that it is plain she has not yet any love for the
      man. She would be somewhat more afraid to show it, delicate as she is. It
      is only friendship&mdash;honest friendship, on her side; and if her
      affections be not engaged somewhere else&mdash;she may be mine: if&mdash;if
      I please&mdash;if&mdash;I can bring myself fairly to propose&mdash;we
      shall see&mdash;I shall think of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And now he began to think of it seriously.&mdash;Miss Stanley&rsquo;s
      indifference to him, and the unusual difficulty which he found in making
      any impression, stimulated him in an extraordinary degree. Helen now
      appeared to him even more beautiful than he had at first thought her&mdash;&ldquo;Those
      eyes that fix so softly,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;those dark eyelashes&mdash;that
      blush coming and going so beautifully&mdash;and there is a timid grace in
      all her motions, with that fine figure too&mdash;and that high-bred turn
      of the neck!&mdash;altogether she is charming! and she will be thought so!&mdash;she
      must be mine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She would do credit to his taste; he thought she would, when she had a
      little more <i>usage du monde</i>, do the honours of his house well; and
      it would be delightful to train her!&mdash;If he could but engage her
      affections, before she had seen more of the world, she might really love
      him for his own sake&mdash;and Churchill wished to be really loved, if
      possible, for his own sake; but of the reality of modern love he justly
      doubted, especially for a man of his fortune and his age; yet, with
      Helen&rsquo;s youth and innocence he began to think he had some chance of
      disinterested attachment, and he determined to bring out for her the
      higher powers of his mind&mdash;the better parts of his character.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day Lady Davenant had been speaking of London conversation. &ldquo;So
      brilliant,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;so short-lived, as my friend Lady Emmeline K&mdash;&mdash;once
      said, &lsquo;London wit is like gas, which lights at a touch, and at a touch can
      be extinguished;&rsquo;&rdquo; and Lady Davenant concluded with a compliment to him
      who was known to have this &ldquo;<i>touch and go</i>&rdquo; of good conversation to
      perfection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Churchill bowed to the compliment, but afterwards sighed, and it
      seemed an honest sigh, from the bottom of his heart. Only Lady Davenant
      and Helen were in the room, and turning to Lady Davenant he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I have it, I have paid dearly for it, more than it is worth, much too
      dearly, by the sacrifice of higher powers; I might have been a very
      different person from what I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen&rsquo;s attention was instantly fixed; but Lady Davenant suspected he was
      now only talking for effect. He saw what she thought&mdash;it was partly
      true, but not quite. He felt what he said at the moment; and besides,
      there is always a sincere pleasure in speaking of one&rsquo;s self when one can
      do it without exposing one&rsquo;s self to ridicule, and with a chance of
      obtaining real sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was my misfortune,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to be spoiled, even in childhood, by my
      mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he pronounced the word &ldquo;mother,&rdquo; either his own heart or Helen&rsquo;s eyes
      made him pause with a look of respectful tenderness. It was cruel of a son
      to blame the fond indulgence of a mother; but the fact was, she brought
      him too forward early as a clever child, fed him too much with that sweet
      dangerous fostering dew of praise. The child&mdash;the man&mdash;must
      suffer for it afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, very true,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant; &ldquo;I quite agree with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could do nothing without flattery,&rdquo; continued he, pursuing the line of
      confession which he saw had fixed Lady Davenant&rsquo;s attention favourably.
      &ldquo;Unluckily, I came too early into possession of a large fortune, and into
      the London world, and I lapped the stream of prosperity as I ran, and it
      was sweet with flattery, intoxicating, and I knew it, and yet could not
      forbear it. Then in a London life every thing is too stimulating&mdash;over-exciting.
      If there are great advantages to men of science and literature in museums
      and public libraries, the more than <i>Avicenna</i> advantages of having
      books come at will, and ministering spirits in waiting on all your
      pursuits&mdash;there is too much of every thing except time, and too
      little of that. The treasures are within our reach, but we cannot clutch;
      we have, but we cannot hold. We have neither leisure to be good, nor to be
      great: who can think of living for posterity, when he can scarcely live
      for the day? and sufficient for the day are never the hours thereof. From
      want of time, and from the immense quantity that nevertheless must be
      known, comes the necessity, the unavoidable necessity of being
      superficial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should it be unavoidable necessity?&rdquo; asked Lady Davenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because <i>should</i> waits upon <i>must</i>, in London always, if not
      elsewhere,&rdquo; said Churchill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A conversation answer,&rdquo; replied Lady Davenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I allow it; it is even so, just so, and to such tricks, such playing
      upon words, do the bad habits of London conversation lead;&rdquo; and Lady
      Davenant wondered at the courage of his candour, as he went on to speak of
      the petty jealousies, the paltry envy, the miserable selfish
      susceptibility generated by the daily competition of London society. Such
      dissensions, such squabbles&mdash;an ignoble but appropriate word&mdash;such
      deplorable, such scandalous squabbles among literary, and even among
      scientific men. &ldquo;And who,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;who can hope to escape in such a
      tainted atmosphere&mdash;an atmosphere overloaded with life, peopled with
      myriads of little buzzing stinging vanities! It really requires the
      strength of Hercules, mind and body, to go through our labours,
      fashionable, political, <i>bel esprit</i>, altogether too much for mortal.
      In parliament, in politics, in the tug of war you see how the strongest
      minds fail, come to untimely&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not touch upon that subject,&rdquo; cried Lady Davenant, suddenly agitated.
      Then, commanding herself, she calmly added&mdash;&ldquo;As you are not now, I
      think, in parliament, it cannot affect you. What were you saying?&mdash;your
      health of mind and body, I think you said, you were sensible had been hurt
      by&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These straining, incessant competitions have hurt me. My health suffered
      first, then my temper. It was originally good, now, as you have seen, I am
      afraid&rdquo;&mdash;glancing at Helen, who quickly looked down, &ldquo;I am afraid I
      am irritable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an awkward silence. Helen thought it was for Lady Davenant to
      speak; but Lady Davenant did not contradict Mr. Churchill. Now, the not
      contradicting a person who is abusing himself, is one of the most heinous
      offences to self-love that can be committed; and it often provokes false
      candour to pull off the mask and throw it in your face; but either Mr.
      Horace Churchill&rsquo;s candour was true, or it was so well guarded at the
      moment that no such catastrophe occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse than this bad effect on my temper!&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;I feel that my
      whole mind has been deteriorated&mdash;my ambition dwindled to the
      shortest span&mdash;my thoughts contracted to the narrow view of mere
      effect; what would please at the dinner-table or at the clubs&mdash;what
      will be thought of me by this literary coterie, or in that fashionable
      boudoir. And for this <i>reputation de salon</i> I have sacrificed all
      hope of other reputation, all power of obtaining it, all hope of &ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;(here
      he added a few words, murmured down to Lady Davenant&rsquo;s embroidery frame,
      yet still in such a tone that Helen could not help thinking he meant she
      should hear)&mdash;&ldquo;If I had a heart such as&mdash;&rdquo; he paused, and, as if
      struck with some agonising thought, he sighed deeply, and then added&mdash;&ldquo;but
      I have not a heart worth such acceptance, or I would make the offer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen was not sure what these words meant, but she now pitied him, and she
      admired his candour, which she thought was so far above the petty sort of
      character he had at first done himself the injustice to seem, and she
      seized the first opportunity to tell Beauclerc all Mr. Churchill had said
      to Lady Davenant and to her, and of the impression it had made upon them
      both. Beauclerc had often discussed Mr. Churchill&rsquo;s character with her,
      but she was disappointed when she saw that what she told made no agreeable
      impression on Beauclerc: at first he stood quite silent, and when she
      asked what he thought, he said&mdash;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very fine, very clever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is all true,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;And I admire Mr. Churchill&rsquo;s knowing
      the truth so well and telling it so candidly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every thing Mr. Churchill has said may be true&mdash;and yet I think the
      truth is not in him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not usually so suspicious,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;If you had heard Mr.
      Churchill&rsquo;s voice and emphasis, and seen his look and manner at the time,
      I think you could not have doubted him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The more eager she grew, the colder Mr. Beauclerc became. &ldquo;Look and
      manner, and voice and emphasis,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;make a great impression, I
      know, on ladies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is your reason, Mr. Beauclerc, for disbelief? I have as yet only
      heard that you believe every thing that Mr. Churchill said was true, and
      yet that you do not believe in his truth,&rdquo; said Helen, in a tone of
      raillery.
    </p>
    <p>
      And many a time before had Beauclerc been the first to laugh when one of
      his own paradoxes stared him in the face; but now he was more out of
      countenance than amused, and he looked seriously about for reasons to
      reconcile his seeming self-contradiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place, all those allusions and those metaphorical
      expressions, which you have so wonderfully well remembered, and which no
      doubt were worth remembering, all those do not give me the idea of a man
      who was really feeling in earnest, and speaking the plain truth about
      faults, for which, if he felt at all, he must be too much ashamed to talk
      in such a grand style; and to talk of them at all, except to most intimate
      friends, seems so unnatural, and quite out of character in a man who had
      expressed such horror of egotists, and who is so excessively circumspect
      in general.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but Mr. Churchill&rsquo;s forgetting all his little habits of
      circumspection, and all fear of ridicule, is the best proof of his being
      quite in earnest&mdash;that all he said was from his heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt whether he has any heart,&rdquo; said Beauclerc.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor man, he said&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Helen began, and then recollecting the
      words, &lsquo;or I would make the offer,&rsquo; she stopped short, afraid of the
      construction they might bear, and then, ashamed of her fear, she coloured
      deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor man, he said&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; repeated Beauclerc, fixing his eyes upon
      her, &ldquo;What did he say, may I ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&mdash;&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;I am not sure that I distinctly heard or
      understood Mr. Churchill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if there was any mystery!&rdquo; Beauclerc begged pardon.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he went away very quickly. He did not touch upon the subject again,
      but Helen saw that he never forgot it; and, by few words which she heard
      him say to Lady Davenant about his dislike to half-confidences, she knew
      he was displeased, and she thought he was wrong. She began to fear that
      his mistrust of Churchill arose from envy at his superior success in
      society; and, though she was anxious to preserve her newly-acquired good
      opinion of Churchill&rsquo;s candour, she did not like to lose her esteem for
      Beauclerc&rsquo;s generosity. Was it possible that he could be seriously hurt at
      the readiness with which Mr. Churchill availed himself of any idea which
      Beauclerc threw out, and which he dressed up, and passed as his own?
      Perhaps this might be what he meant by &ldquo;the truth is not in him.&rdquo; She
      remembered one day when she sat between him and Beauclerc, and when he did
      not seem to pay the least attention to what Mr. Beauclerc was saying to
      her, yet fully occupied as he had apparently been in talking for the
      company in general, he had through all heard Granville telling the Chinese
      fable of the &ldquo;Man in the Moon, whose business it is to knit together with
      an invisible silken cord those who are predestined for each other.&rdquo;
       Presently, before the dessert was over, Helen found the &ldquo;Chinese Man in
      the Moon,&rdquo; whom she thought she had all to herself, figuring at the other
      end of the table, and received with great applause. And was it possible
      that Beauclerc, with his abundant springs of genius, could grudge a drop
      thus stolen from him? but without any envy in the case, he was right in
      considering such theft, however petty, as a theft, and right in despising
      the meanness of the thief. Such meanness was strangely incompatible with
      Mr. Churchill&rsquo;s frank confession of his own faults. Could that confession
      be only for effect?
    </p>
    <p>
      Her admiration had been sometimes excited by a particular happiness of
      thought, beauty of expression, or melody of language in Mr. Churchill&rsquo;s
      conversation. Once Beauclerc had been speaking with enthusiasm of modern
      Greece, and his hopes that she might recover her ancient character; and
      Mr. Churchill, as if admiring the enthusiasm, yet tempering it with better
      judgment, smiled, paused, and answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Greece is a dangerous field for a political speculator; the
      imagination produces an illusion resembling the beautiful appearances
      which are sometimes exhibited in the Sicilian straits; the reflected
      images of ancient Grecian glory pass in a rapid succession before the
      mental eye; and, delighted with the captivating forms of greatness and
      splendour, we forget for a moment that the scene is in reality a naked
      waste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some people say they can distinguish between a written and a spoken style,
      but this depends a good deal on the art of the speaker. Churchill could
      give a colloquial tone to a ready-written sentence, and could speak it
      with an off-hand grace, a carelessness which defied all suspicion of
      preparation; and the look, and pause, and precipitation&mdash;each and all
      came in aid of the actor&rsquo;s power of perfecting the illusion. If you had
      heard and seen him, you would have believed that, in speaking this
      passage, the thought of the <i>Fata Morgana</i> rose in his mind at the
      instant, and that, seeing it pleased you, and pleased with it himself,
      encouraged by your look of intelligence, and borne along by your sympathy,
      the eloquent man followed his own idea with a happiness more than care,
      admirable in conversation. A few days afterwards, Helen was very much
      surprised to find her admired sentence word for word in a book, from which
      Churchill&rsquo;s card fell as she opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Persons without a name Horace treated as barbarians who did not know the
      value of their gold; and he seemed to think that, if they chanced to
      possess rings and jewels, they might be plucked from them without remorse,
      and converted to better use by some lucky civilised adventurer. Yet in his
      most successful piracies he was always haunted by the fear of discovery,
      and he especially dreaded the acute perception of Lady Davenant; he
      thought she suspected his arts of appropriation, and he took the first
      convenient opportunity of sounding her opinion on this point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How I enjoy,&rdquo; said he to Lady Cecilia &ldquo;telling a good story to you, for
      you never ask if it is a fact. Now, in a good story, no one sticks to
      absolute fact; there must be some little embellishment. No one would send
      his own or his friend&rsquo;s story into the world without &lsquo;putting a hat on its
      head, and a stick into its hand,&rsquo;&rdquo; Churchill triumphantly quoted; this
      time he did not steal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant, &ldquo;I find that even the pleasure I have in mere
      characteristic or humorous narration is heightened by my dependence on the
      truth&mdash;the character for truth&mdash;of the narrator.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not only Horace Churchill, but almost every body present, except Helen,
      confessed that they could not agree with her. The character for truth of
      the story-teller had nothing to do with his story, unless it was <i>historique</i>,
      or that he was to swear to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And even if it were <i>historique</i>,&rdquo; cried Horace, buoyed up at the
      moment by the tide in his favour, and floating out farther than was
      prudent&mdash;&ldquo;and even if it were <i>historique</i>, how much pleasanter
      is graceful fiction than grim, rigid truth; and how much more amusing in
      my humble opinion!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant, &ldquo;for instance, this book I am reading&mdash;(it
      was Dumont&rsquo;s &lsquo;Mémoires de Mirabeau&rsquo;)&mdash;this book which I am reading,
      gives me infinitely increased pleasure, from my certain knowledge, my
      perfect conviction of the truth of the author. The self-evident nature of
      some of the facts would support themselves, you may say, in some
      instances; but my perceiving the scrupulous care he takes to say no more
      than what he knows to be true, my perfect reliance on the relater&rsquo;s
      private character for integrity, gives a zest to every anecdote he tells&mdash;a
      specific weight to every word of conversation which he repeats&mdash;appropriate
      value to every trait of wit or humour characteristic of the person he
      describes. Without such belief, the characters would not have to me, as
      they now have, all the power, and charm, and life, of nature and reality.
      They are all now valuable as records of individual varieties that have
      positively so existed. While the most brilliant writer could, by fiction,
      have produced an effect, valuable only as representing the general average
      of human nature, but adding nothing to our positive knowledge, to the data
      from which we can reason in future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Churchill understood Lady Davenant too well to stand quite unembarrassed
      as he listened; and when she went on to say how differently she should
      have felt in reading these memoirs if they had been written by Mirabeau
      himself; with all his brilliancy, all his talents, how inferior would have
      been her enjoyment as well as instruction! his shrinking conscience told
      him how this might all be applied to himself; yet, strange to say, though
      somewhat abashed, he was nevertheless flattered by the idea of a parallel
      between himself and Mirabeau. To <i>Mirabeauder</i> was no easy task; it
      was a certain road to notoriety, if not to honest fame.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even in the better parts of his character, his liberality in money
      matters, his good-natured patronage of rising genius, the meanness of his
      mind broke out. There was a certain young poetess whom he had encouraged;
      she happened to be sister to Mr. Mapletofft, Lord Davenant&rsquo;s secretary,
      and she had spoken with enthusiastic gratitude of Mr. Churchill&rsquo;s
      kindness. She was going to publish a volume of Sonnets under Mr.
      Churchill&rsquo;s patronage, and, as she happened to be now at some country town
      in the neighbourhood, he requested Lady Cecilia to allow him to introduce
      this young authoress to her. She was invited for a few days to Clarendon
      Park, and Mr. Churchill was zealous to procure subscriptions for her, and
      eager to lend the aid of his fashion and his literary reputation to bring
      forward the merits of her book. &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;he had given her
      some little help in the composition,&rdquo; and all went well till, in an evil
      hour, Helen praised one of the sonnets rather too much&mdash;more, he
      thought, than she had praised another, which was his own. His jealousy
      wakened&mdash;he began to criticise his protegée&rsquo;s poetry. Helen defended
      her admiration, and reminded him that he had himself recommended these
      lines to her notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&mdash;yes&mdash;I did say the best I could for the whole thing, and
      for her it is surprising&mdash;that is, I am anxious the publication
      should take. But if we come to compare&mdash;you know this cannot stand
      certain comparisons that might be made. Miss Stanley&rsquo;s own taste and
      judgment must perceive&mdash;when we talk of genius&mdash;that is quite
      out of the question, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace was so perplexed between his philanthropy and his jealousy, his
      desire to show the one and his incapability of concealing the other, that
      he became unintelligible; and Helen laughed, and told him that she could
      not now understand what his opinion really was. She was quite ready to
      agree with him, she said, if he would but agree with himself: this made
      him disagree still more with himself and unluckily with his better self,
      his benevolence quite gave way before his jealousy and ill-humour, and he
      vented it upon the book; and, instead of prophecies of its success, he now
      groaned over &ldquo;sad careless lines,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;passages that lead to nothing,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;similes
      that will not hold when you come to examine them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen pointed out in the dedication a pretty, a happy thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace smiled, and confessed that was his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      What! in the dedication to himself?&mdash;and in the blindness of his
      vanity he did not immediately see the absurdity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more he felt himself in the wrong, of course the more angry he grew,
      and it finished by his renouncing the dedication altogether, declaring he
      would have none of it. The book and the lady might find a better patron.
      There are things which no man of real generosity could say or do, or
      think, put him in ever so great a passion. He would not be harsh to an
      inferior&mdash;a woman&mdash;a protegée on whom he had conferred
      obligations; but Mr. Churchill was harsh&mdash;he showed neither
      generosity nor feeling; and Helen&rsquo;s good opinion of him sank to rise no
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of this, however, he had not enough of the sympathy or penetration of
      feeling to be aware.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The party now at Clarendon Park consisted chiefly of young people. Among
      them were two cousins of Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s, whom Helen had known at
      Cecilhurst before they went abroad, while she was still almost a child.
      Lady Katrine Hawksby, the elder, was several years older than Cecilia.
      When Helen last saw her, she was tolerably well-looking, very fashionable,
      and remarkable for high spirits, with a love for <i>quizzing</i>, and for
      all that is vulgarly called <i>fun</i>, and a talent for ridicule, which
      she indulged at everybody&rsquo;s expense. She had always amused Cecilia, who
      thought her more diverting than really ill-natured; but Helen thought her
      more ill-natured than diverting, never liked her, and had her own private
      reasons for thinking that she was no good friend to Cecilia: but now, in
      consequence either of the wear and tear of London life, or of a
      disappointment in love or matrimony, she had lost the fresh plumpness of
      youth; and gone too was that spirit of mirth, if not of good humour, which
      used to enliven her countenance. Thin and sallow, the sharp features
      remained, and the sarcastic without the arch expression; still she had a
      very fashionable air. Her pretensions to youth, as her dress showed, were
      not gone; and her hope of matrimony, though declining, not set. Her
      many-years-younger sister, Louisa, now Lady Castlefort, was beautiful. As
      a girl, she had been the most sentimental, refined, delicate creature
      conceivable; always talking poetry&mdash;and so romantic&mdash;with such a
      soft, sweet, die-away voice&mdash;lips apart&mdash;and such fine eyes,
      that could so ecstatically turn up to heaven, or be so cast down,
      charmingly fixed in contemplation:&mdash;and now she is married, just the
      same. There she is, established in the library at Clarendon Park, with the
      most sentimental fashionable novel of the day, beautifully bound, on the
      little rose-wood table beside her, and a manuscript poem, a great secret,
      &ldquo;Love&rsquo;s Last Sigh,&rdquo; in her bag with her smelling-bottle and embroidered
      handkerchief; and on that beautiful arm she leaned so gracefully, with her
      soft languishing expression; so perfectly dressed too&mdash;handsomer than
      ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen was curious to know what sort of man Lady Louisa had married, for
      she recollected that no hero of any novel that ever was read, or talked
      of, came up to her idea of what a hero ought to be, of what a man must be,
      whom she could ever think of loving. Cecilia told Helen that she had seen
      Lord Castlefort, but that he was not Lord Castlefort, or likely to be Lord
      Castlefort, at that time; and she bade her guess, among all she could
      recollect having ever seen at Cecilhurst, who the man of Louisa&rsquo;s choice
      could be. Lady Katrine, with infinite forbearance, smiled, and gave no
      hint, while Helen guessed and guessed in vain. She was astonished when she
      saw him come into the room. He was a little deformed man, for whom Lady
      Louisa had always expressed to her companions a peculiar abhorrence. He
      had that look of conceit which unfortunately sometimes accompanies
      personal deformity, and which disgusts even Pity&rsquo;s self. Lord Castlefort
      was said to have declared himself made for love and fighting! Helen
      remembered that kind-hearted Cecilia had often remonstrated for humanity&rsquo;s
      sake, and stopped the quizzing which used to go on in their private
      coteries, when the satirical elder sister would have it that <i>le petit
      bossu</i> was in love with Louisa.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what <i>could</i> make her marry him? Was there anything within to
      make amends for the exterior? Nothing&mdash;nothing that could &ldquo;rid him of
      the lump behind.&rdquo; But superior to the metamorphoses of love, or of fairy
      tale, are the metamorphoses of fortune. Fortune had suddenly advanced him
      to uncounted thousands and a title, and no longer <i>le petit bossu</i>,
      Lord Castlefort obtained the fair hand&mdash;the very fair hand of Lady
      Louisa Hawksby, <i>plus belle que fée!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Still Helen could not believe that Louisa had married him voluntarily; but
      Lady Cecilia assured her that it was voluntarily, quite voluntarily. &ldquo;You
      could not have so doubted had you seen the <i>trousseau</i> and the <i>corbeille</i>,
      for you know, &lsquo;<i>Le présent fait oublier le futur</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen could scarcely smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Louisa had feeling&mdash;really some,&rdquo; continued Lady Cecilia; &ldquo;but
      she could not afford to follow it. She had got into such debt, I really do
      not know what she would have done if Lord Castlefort had not proposed; but
      she has some little heart, and I could tell you a secret; but no, I will
      leave you the pleasure of finding it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be no pleasure to me,&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never saw anybody so out of spirits,&rdquo; cried Lady Cecilia, laughing, &ldquo;at
      another&rsquo;s unfortunate marriage, which all the time she thinks very
      fortunate. She is quite happy, and even Katrine does not laugh at him any
      longer, it is to be supposed; it is no laughing matter now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No indeed,&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor a crying matter either,&rdquo; said Cecilia. &ldquo;Do not look shocked at me, my
      dear, I did not do it; but so many do, and I have seen it so often, that I
      cannot wonder with such a foolish face of blame&mdash;I do believe, my
      dear Helen, that you are envious because Louisa is married before you! for
      shame, my love! Envy is a naughty passion, you know our Madame Bonne used
      to say; but here&rsquo;s mamma, now talk to her about Louisa Castlefort, pray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Davenant took the matter with great coolness, was neither shocked nor
      surprised at this match, she had known so many worse; Lord Castlefort, as
      well as she recollected, was easy enough to live with. &ldquo;And after all,&rdquo;
       said she, &ldquo;it is better than what we see every day, the fairest of the
      fair knowingly, willingly giving themselves to the most profligate of the
      profligate, In short, the market is so overstocked with accomplished young
      ladies on the one hand, and on the other, men find wives and
      establishments so expensive, clubs so cheap and so much more luxurious
      than any home, liberty not only so sweet but so fashionable, that their
      policy, their maxim is, &lsquo;Marry not at all, or if marriage be ultimately
      necessary to pay debts and leave heirs to good names, marry as late as
      possible;&rsquo; and thus the two parties with their opposite interests stand at
      bay, or try to outwit or outbargain each other. And if you wish for the
      moral of the whole affair, here it is from the vulgar nursery-maids, with
      their broad sense and bad English, and the good or bad French of the
      governess, to the elegant innuendo of the drawing-room, all is working to
      the same effect: dancing-masters, music-masters, and all the tribe, what
      is it all for, but to prepare young ladies for the grand event; and to
      raise in them, besides the natural, a factitious, an abstract idea of good
      in being married! Every girl in these days is early impressed with the
      idea that she must be married, that she cannot be happy unmarried. Here is
      an example of what I meant the other day by strength of mind; it requires
      some strength of mind to be superior to such a foolish, vain, and vulgar
      belief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will require no great strength of mind in me,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;for I
      really never have formed such notions. They never were early put into my
      head; my uncle always said a woman might be very happy unmarried. I do not
      think I shall ever be seized with a terror of dying an old maid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not come to the time yet, my dear,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant smiling.
      &ldquo;Look at Lady Katrine; strength of mind on this one subject would have
      saved her from being a prey to envy, and jealousy, and all the vulture
      passions of the mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the old French <i>régime</i>,&rdquo; continued Lady Davenant, &ldquo;the young
      women were at least married safely out of their convents; but our young
      ladies, with their heads full of high-flown poetry and sentimental novels,
      are taken out into the world before marriage, expected to see and not to
      choose, shown the most agreeable, and expected, doomed to marry the most
      odious. But, in all these marriages for establishment, the wives who have
      least feeling are not only likely to be the happiest, but also most likely
      to conduct themselves well. In the first place they do not begin with
      falsehood. If they have no hearts, they cannot pretend to give any to the
      husband, and that is better than having given them to somebody else.
      Husband and wife, in this case, clearly understand the terms of agreement,
      expect, imagine no more than they have, and jog-trot they go on together
      to the end of life very comfortably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Comfortably!&rdquo; exclaimed Helen, &ldquo;it must be most miserable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not most miserable, Helen,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant, &ldquo;keep your pity for
      others; keep your sighs for those who need them&mdash;for the heart which
      no longer dares to utter a sigh for itself, the faint heart that dares to
      love, but dares not abide by its choice. Such infatuated creatures, with
      the roots of feeling left aching within them, must take what opiates they
      can find; and in after-life, through all their married existence, their
      prayer must be for indifference, and thankful may they be if that prayer
      is granted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words recurred to Helen that evening, when Lady Castlefort sang some
      tender and passionate airs; played on the harp with a true Saint Cecilia
      air and attitude; and at last, with charming voice and touching
      expression, sung her favourite&mdash;&ldquo;Too late for redress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both Mr. Churchill and Beauclerc were among the group of gentlemen;
      neither was a stranger to her. Mr. Churchill admired and applauded as a
      connoisseur. Beauclerc listened in silence. Mr. Churchill entreated for
      more&mdash;more&mdash;and named several of his favourite Italian airs. Her
      ladyship really could not. But the slightest indication of a wish from
      Beauclerc, was, without turning towards him, heard and attended to, as her
      sister failed not to remark and to make others remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seizing a convenient pause while Mr. Churchill was searching for some
      master-piece, Lady Katrine congratulated her sister on having recovered
      her voice, and declared that she had never heard her play or sing since
      she was married till tonight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may consider it as a very particular compliment, I assure you,&rdquo;
       continued she, addressing herself so particularly to Mr. Beauclerc that he
      could not help being a little out of countenance,&mdash;&ldquo;I have so begged
      and prayed, but she was never in voice or humour, or heart, or something.
      Yesterday, even Castlefort was almost on his knees for a song,&mdash;were
      not you, Lord Castlefort?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Castlefort pinched his pointed chin, and casting up an angry look,
      replied in a dissonant voice,&mdash;&ldquo;I do not remember!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Tout voir, tout entendre, tout oublier</i>,&rdquo; whispered Lady Katrine to
      Mr. Churchill, as she stooped to assist him in the search for a music-book&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Tout
      voir, tout entendre, tout oublier</i>, should be the motto adopted by all
      married people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Castlefort seemed distressed, and turned over the leaves in such a
      flutter that she could not find anything, and she rose, in spite of all
      entreaties, leaving the place to her sister, who was, she said, &ldquo;so much
      better a musician and not so foolishly nervous.&rdquo; Lady Castlefort said her
      &ldquo;voice always went away when she was at all&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There it ended as far as words went; but she sighed, and retired so
      gracefully, that all the gentlemen pitied her.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is one moment in which ill-nature sincerely repents&mdash;the moment
      when it sees pity felt for its victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace followed Lady Castlefort to the ottoman, on which she sank.
      Beauclerc remained leaning on the back of Lady Katrine&rsquo;s chair, but
      without seeming to hear what she said or sung. After some time Mr.
      Churchill, not finding his attentions well received, or weary of paying
      them, quitted Lady Castlefort but sat down by Helen; and in a voice to be
      heard by her, but by no one else, he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a relief!&mdash;I thought I should never get away!&rdquo; Then, favoured
      by a loud bravura of Lady Katrine&rsquo;s, he went on&mdash;&ldquo;That beauty,
      between you and me, is something of a bore&mdash;she&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mean
      the lady who is now screaming&mdash;she should always sing. Heaven blessed
      her with song, not sense&mdash;but here one is made so fastidious!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sighed, and for some moments seemed to be given up to the duet which
      Lady Katrine and an officer were performing; and then exclaimed, but so
      that Helen only could hear,&mdash;&ldquo;Merciful Heaven! how often one wishes
      one had no ears: that Captain Jones must be the son of Stentor, and that
      lady!&mdash;if angels sometimes saw themselves in a looking-glass when
      singing&mdash;there would be peace upon earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen, not liking to be the secret receiver of his contraband good things,
      was rising to change her place, when softly detaining her, he said, &ldquo;Do
      not be afraid, no danger&mdash;trust me, for I have studied under Talma.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;that Talma taught me the secret of his dying
      scenes&mdash;how every syllable of his dying words might be heard to the
      furthest part of the audience; and I&mdash;give me credit for my ingenuity&mdash;know
      how, by reversing the art, to be perfectly inaudible at ten paces&rsquo; 
      distance, and yet, I trust, perfectly intelligible, always, to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen now rose decidedly, and retreated to a table at the other side of
      the room, and turned over some books that lay there&mdash;she took up a
      volume of the novel Lady Castlefort had been reading&mdash;&ldquo;Love
      unquestionable.&rdquo; She was surprised to find it instantly, gently, but
      decidedly drawn from her hand: she looked up&mdash;it was Beauclerc.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, Miss Stanley, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you! thank you!&rdquo; said Helen; &ldquo;you need not beg my pardon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the first time Beauclerc had spoken in his friendly, cordial,
      natural manner, to her, since their incomprehensible misunderstanding. She
      was heartily glad it was over, and that he was come to himself again. And
      now they conversed very happily together for some time; though what they
      said might not be particularly worth recording. Lady Katrine was at
      Helen&rsquo;s elbow before she perceived her &ldquo;looking for her sac;&rdquo; and Lady
      Castlefort came for her third volume, and gliding off, wished to all&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Felice,
      felicissima notte</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Neither of these sisters had ever liked Helen; she was too true for the
      one, and too good-natured for the other. Lady Katrine had always, even
      when she was quite a child, been jealous of Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s affection for
      Helen; and now her indignation and disappointment were great at finding
      her established at Clarendon Park&mdash;to live with the Clarendons, to <i>go
      out</i> with Lady Cecilia. Now, it had been the plan of both sisters, that
      Lady Katrine&rsquo;s present visit should be eternal. How they would ever have
      managed to fasten her ladyship upon the General, even if Helen had been
      out of the question, need not now be considered. Their disappointment and
      dislike to Helen were as great as if she had been the only obstacle to the
      fulfilment of their scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
      These two sisters had never agreed&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">  &mdash;&ldquo;Doom&rsquo;d by Fate<br />  To live in all the elegance of hate;"<br /></pre>
    <p>
      and since Lady Castlefort&rsquo;s marriage, the younger, the beautiful being now
      the successful lady of the ascendant, the elder writhed in all the
      combined miseries of jealousy and dependance, and an everyday lessening
      chance of bettering her condition. Lord Castlefort, too, for good reasons
      of his own, well remembered, detested Lady Katrine, and longed to shake
      her off. In this wish, at least, husband and wife united; but Lady
      Castlefort had no decent excuse for her ardent impatience to get rid of
      her sister. She had magnificent houses in town and country, ample room
      everywhere&mdash;but in her heart. She had the smallest heart conceivable,
      and the coldest; but had it been ever so large, or ever so warm, Lady
      Katrine was surely not the person to get into it, or into any heart, male
      or female: there was the despair. &ldquo;If Katrine was but married&mdash;Mr.
      Churchill, suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Faint was the <i>suppose</i> in Lady Castlefort&rsquo;s imagination. Not so the
      hope which rose in Lady Katrine&rsquo;s mind the moment she saw him here. &ldquo;How
      fortunate!&rdquo; Her ladyship had now come to that no particular age, when a
      remarkable metaphysical phenomenon occurs; on one particular subject hope
      increases as all probability of success decreases. This aberration of
      intellect is usually observed to be greatest in very clever women; while
      Mr. Churchill, the flattered object of her present hope, knew how to
      manage with great innocence and modesty, and draw her on to overt acts of
      what is called flirtation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rousseau says that a man is always awkward and miserable when placed
      between two women to whom he is making love. But Rousseau had never seen
      Mr. Churchill, and had but an imperfect idea of the dexterity, the
      ambiguity, that in our days can be successfully practised by an
      accomplished male coquette. Absolutely to blind female jealousy may be
      beyond his utmost skill; but it is easy, as every day&rsquo;s practice shows, to
      keep female vanity pleasantly perplexed by ocular deception&mdash;to make
      her believe that what she really sees she does not see, and that what is
      unreal is reality: to make her, to the amusement of the spectators,
      continually stretch out her hand to snatch the visionary good that for
      ever eludes her grasp, or changes, on near approach, to grinning mockery.
    </p>
    <p>
      This delightful game was now commenced with Lady Katrine, and if Helen
      could be brought to take a snatch, it would infinitely increase the
      interest and amusement of the lookers on. Of this, however, there seemed
      little chance; but the evil eye of envy was set upon her, and the demon of
      jealousy was longing to work her woe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Castlefort saw with scornful astonishment that Mr. Beauclerc&rsquo;s eyes,
      sometimes when she was speaking, or when she was singing, would stray to
      that part of the room where Miss Stanley might be; and when she was
      speaking to him, he was wonderfully absent. Her ladyship rallied him,
      while Lady Katrine, looking on, cleared her throat in her horrid way, and
      longed for an opportunity to discomfit Helen, which supreme pleasure her
      ladyship promised herself upon the first convenient occasion,&mdash;convenient
      meaning when Lady Davenant was out of the room; for Lady Katrine, though
      urged by prompting jealousy, dared not attack her when under cover of that
      protection. From long habit, even her sarcastic nature stood in awe of a
      certain power of moral indignation, which had at times flashed upon her,
      and of which she had a sort of superstitious dread, as of an
      incomprehensible, incalculable power.
    </p>
    <p>
      But temper will get the better of all prudence. Piqued by some little
      preference which Lady Cecilia had shown to Helen&rsquo;s taste in the choice of
      the colour of a dress, an occasion offered of signalising her revenge,
      which could not be resisted. It was a question to be publicly decided,
      whether blue, green, or white should be adopted for the ladies&rsquo; uniform at
      an approaching <i>fête</i>. She was deputed to collect the votes. All the
      company were assembled; Lady Davenant, out of the circle, as it was a
      matter that concerned her not, was talking to the gentlemen apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Katrine went round canvassing. &ldquo;Blue, green, or white? say blue, <i>pray</i>.&rdquo;
       But when she came to Helen, she made a full stop, asked no question&mdash;preferred
      no prayer, but after fixing attention by her pause, said, &ldquo;I need not ask
      Miss Stanley&rsquo;s vote or opinion, as I know my cousin&rsquo;s, and with Miss
      Stanley it is always &lsquo;I say ditto to Lady Cecilia;&rsquo; therefore, to save
      trouble, I always count two for Cecilia&mdash;one for herself and one for
      her <i>double</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right, Lady Katrine Hawksby,&rdquo; cried a voice from afar, which made her
      start; &ldquo;you are quite right to consider Helen Stanley as my daughter&rsquo;s
      double, for my daughter loves and esteems her as her second self&mdash;her
      better self. In this sense Helen is Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s double, but if you mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me! I don&rsquo;t know what I meant, I declare. I could not have
      conceived that Lady Davenant&mdash;&mdash;Miss Stanley, I beg a thousand
      million of pardons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen, with anxious good-nature, pardoned before she was asked, and
      hastened to pass on to the business of the day, but Lady Davenant would
      not so let it pass; her eye still fixed she pursued the quailing enemy&mdash;&ldquo;One
      word more. In justice to my daughter, I must say her love has not been won
      by flattery, as none knows better than the Lady Katrine Hawksby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The unkindest cut of all, and on the tenderest part. Lady Katrine could
      not stand it. Conscious and trembling, she broke through the circle, fled
      into the conservatory, and, closing the doors behind her, would not be
      followed by Helen, Cecilia, or any body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Castlefort sighed, and first breaking the silence that ensued, said,
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis such a pity that Katrine will always so let her wit run away with
      her&mdash;it brings her so continually into&mdash;&mdash;for my part, in
      all humility I must confess, I can&rsquo;t help thinking that, what with its
      being unfeminine and altogether so incompatible with what in general is
      thought amiable&mdash;I cannot but consider wit in a woman as a real
      misfortune. What say the gentlemen? they must decide, gentlemen being
      always the best judges.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With an appealing tone of interrogation she gracefully looked up to the
      gentlemen; and after a glance towards Granville Beauclerc, unluckily
      unnoticed or unanswered, her eyes expected reply from Horace Churchill.
      He, well feeling the predicament in which he stood, between a fool and a
      <i>femme d&rsquo;esprit</i>, answered, with his ambiguous smile, &ldquo;that no doubt
      it was a great misfortune to have &lsquo;<i>plus d&rsquo;esprit qu&rsquo;on ne sait mêner</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a misfortune,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant, &ldquo;that may be deplored for a
      great genius once in an age, but is really rather of uncommon occurrence.
      People complain of wit where, nine times in ten, poor wit is quite
      innocent; but such is the consequence of having kept bad company. Wit and
      ill-nature having been too often found together, when we see one we expect
      the other; and such an inseparable false association has been formed, that
      half the world take it for granted that there is wit if they do but see
      ill-nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Mr. Mapletofft, the secretary, entered with his face full
      of care, and his hands full of papers. Lady Katrine needed not to feign or
      feel any further apprehensions of Lady Davenant; for, an hour afterwards,
      it was announced that Lord and Lady Davenant were obliged to set off for
      town immediately. In the midst of her hurried preparations Lady Davenant
      found a moment to comfort Helen with the assurance that, whatever
      happened, she would see her again. It might end in Lord Davenant&rsquo;s embassy
      being given up. At all events she would see her again&mdash;she hoped in a
      few weeks, perhaps in a few days. &ldquo;So no leave-takings, my dear child, and
      no tears&mdash;it is best as it is. On my return let me find&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Davenant&rsquo;s waiting, my lady,&rdquo; and she hurried away.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Absent or present, the guardian influence of a superior friend is one of
      the greatest blessings on earth, and after Lady Davenant&rsquo;s departure Helen
      was so full of all she had said to her, and of all that she would approve
      or disapprove, that every action, almost every thought, was under the
      influence of her friend&rsquo;s mind. Continually she questioned her motives as
      well as examined her actions, and she could not but condemn some of her
      conduct, or if not her conduct, her manner, towards Horace Churchill; she
      had been flattered by his admiration, and had permitted his attentions
      more than she ought, when her own mind was perfectly made up as to his
      character. Ever since the affair of the poetess, she had been convinced
      that she could never make the happiness or redeem the character of one so
      mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the ladies&rsquo; code, a woman is never to understand that a
      gentleman&rsquo;s attentions mean anything more than common civility; she is
      supposed never to see his mind, however he may make it visible, till he
      declares it in words. But, as Helen could not help understanding his
      manner, she thought it was but fair to make him understand her by her
      manner. She was certain that if he were once completely convinced, not
      only that he had not made any impression, but that he never could make any
      impression, on her heart, his pursuit would cease. His vanity, mortified,
      might revenge itself upon her, perhaps; but this was a danger which she
      thought she ought to brave; and now she resolved to be quite sincere, as
      she said to herself, at whatever hazard (probably meaning at the hazard of
      displeasing Cecilia) she would make her own sentiments clear, and put an
      end to Mr. Churchill&rsquo;s ambiguous conduct: and this should be done on the
      very first opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      An opportunity soon occurred&mdash;Horace had a beautiful little topaz
      ring with which Lady Katrine Hawksby fell into raptures; such a charming
      device!&mdash;Cupid and Momus making the world their plaything.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evident that Lady Katrine expected that the seal should be
      presented to her. Besides being extravagantly fond of baubles, she desired
      to have this homage from Horace. To her surprise and mortification,
      however, he was only quite flattered by her approving of his taste:&mdash;it
      was his favourite seal, and so &ldquo;he kept the topaz, and the rogue was bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Katrine was the more mortified by this failure, because it was
      witnessed by many of the company, among whom, when she looked round, she
      detected smiles of provoking intelligence. Soon afterwards the
      dressing-bell rang and she quitted the room; one after another every one
      dropped off, except Helen, who was finishing a letter, and Horace, who
      stood on the hearth playing with his seal. When she came to sealing-time,
      he approached and besought her to honour him by the acceptance of this
      little seal. &ldquo;If he could obliterate Momus&mdash;if he could leave only
      Cupid, it would be more appropriate. But it was a device invented for him
      by a French friend, and he hoped she would pardon his folly, and think
      only of his love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was said so that it might pass either for mere jest or for earnest;
      his look expressed very sentimental love, and Helen seized the moment to
      explain herself decidedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a surprise&mdash;a great surprise to Mr. Churchill, a severe
      disappointment, not only to his vanity but to his heart, for he had one.
      It was some comfort, however, that he had not quite committed himself, and
      he recovered&mdash;even in the moment of disappointment he recovered
      himself time enough dexterously to turn the tables upon Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thanked her for her candour&mdash;for her great care of his happiness,
      in anticipating a danger which might have been so fatal to him; but he
      really was not aware that he had said anything which required so serious
      an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards he amused himself with Lady Katrine at Miss Stanley&rsquo;s expense,
      representing himself as in the most pitiable case of Rejected Addresses&mdash;rejected
      before he had offered. He had only been guilty of Folly, and he was
      brought in guilty of Love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Helen had to endure not only this persiflage, which was soon made to
      reach her ear, but also the reproaches of Lady Cecilia, who said, &ldquo;I
      should have warned you, Helen, not to irritate that man&rsquo;s relentless
      vanity; now you see the consequences.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, after all, what harm can he do me?&rdquo; thought Helen. &ldquo;It is very
      disagreeable to be laughed at, but still my conscience is satisfied, and
      that is a happiness that will last; all the rest will soon be over. I am
      sure I did the thing awkwardly, but I am glad it is done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Churchill soon afterwards received an invitation&mdash;a command to
      join a royal party now at some watering-place; an illustrious person could
      not live another day without Horace <i>le désiré</i>. He showed the note,
      and acted despair at being compelled to go, and then he departed. To the
      splendid party he went, and drowned all recollections of whatever love he
      had felt in the fresh intoxication of vanity&mdash;a diurnal stimulus
      which, however degrading, and he did feel it degrading, was now become
      necessary to his existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      His departure from Clarendon Park was openly regretted by Lady Cecilia,
      while Lady Katrine secretly mourned over the downfall of her projects, and
      Beauclerc attempted not to disguise his satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was all life and love, and would then certainly have declared his
      passion, but for an extraordinary change which now appeared in Helen&rsquo;s
      manner towards him. It seemed unaccountable; it could not be absolute
      caprice, she did not even treat him as a friend, and she evidently avoided
      explanation. He thought, and thought, and came as near the truth without
      touching it as possible. He concluded that she had understood his joy at
      Churchill&rsquo;s departure; that she now clearly perceived his attachment; and
      was determined against him. Not having the slightest idea that she
      considered him as a married man, he could not even guess the nature of her
      feelings. And all the time Helen did not well understand herself; she
      began to be extremely alarmed at her own feelings&mdash;to dread that
      there was something not quite right. This dread, which had come and gone
      by fits,&mdash;this doubt as to her own sentiments,&mdash;was first
      excited by the death of her dove&mdash;Beauclerc&rsquo;s gift. The poor dove was
      found one morning drowned in the marble vase in which it went to drink.
      Helen was very sorry&mdash;that was surely natural; but she was
      wonderfully concerned. Lady Katrine scoffingly said; and before everybody,
      before Beauclerc, worse than all, her ladyship represented to the best of
      her ability the attitude in which she had found Helen mourning over her
      misfortune, the dove in her hand pressed close to her bosom&mdash;&ldquo;And in
      tears&mdash;absolutely.&rdquo; She would swear to the tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen blushed, tried to laugh, and acknowledged it was very foolish. Well,
      that passed off as only foolish, and she did not at first feel that it was
      a thing much to be ashamed of in any other way. But she was sorry that
      Beauclere was by when Lady Katrine mimicked her; most sorry that he should
      think her foolish. But then did he? His looks expressed tenderness. He was
      very tender-hearted. Really manly men always are so; and so she observed
      to Lady Cecilia. Lady Katrine heard the observation, and smiled&mdash;her
      odious smile&mdash;implying more than words could say. Helen was not quite
      clear, however, what it meant to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some days afterwards Lady Katrine took up a book, in which Helen&rsquo;s name
      was written in Beauclerc&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;<i>Gage d&rsquo;amitié?</i>&rdquo; said her
      ladyship; and she walked up and down the room, humming the air of an old
      French song; interrupting herself now and then to ask her sister if she
      could recollect the words. &ldquo;The <i>refrain</i>, if I remember right, is
      something like this&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">  Sous le nom d&rsquo;amitié&mdash;sous le nom d&rsquo;amitié,<br />  La moitié du monde trompe l&rsquo;autre moitié,<br />  Sous le nom, sous le nom, sous le nom d&rsquo;amitié.<br /></pre>
    <p>
      And it ends with
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">  Sous le nom d&rsquo;amitié, Damon, je vous adore,<br />  Sous le nom, sous le nom d&rsquo;amitié.<br /></pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Stanley, do you know that song?&rdquo; concluded her malicious ladyship.
      No&mdash;Miss Stanley had never heard it before; but the marked emphasis
      with which Lady Katrine sung and looked, made Helen clear that she meant
      to apply the words tauntingly to her and Beauclerc,&mdash;but which of
      them her ladyship suspected was cheating, or cheated&mdash;&ldquo;<i>sous le nom
      d&rsquo;amitié</i>,&rdquo; she did not know. All was confusion in her mind. After a
      moment&rsquo;s cooler reflection, however, she was certain it could not be
      Beauclerc who was to blame&mdash;it must be herself, and she now very much
      wished that every body, and Lady Katrine in particular, should know that
      Mr. Beauclerc was engaged&mdash;almost married; if this were but known, it
      would put an end to all such imputations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first time she could speak to Cecilia on the subject, she begged to
      know how soon Mr. Beauclerc&rsquo;s engagement would be declared. Lady Cecilia
      slightly answered she could not tell&mdash;and when Helen pressed the
      question she asked,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you so anxious, Helen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen honestly told her, and Lady Cecilia only laughed at her for minding
      what Lady Katrine said,&mdash;&ldquo;When you know yourself, Helen, how it is,
      what can it signify what mistakes others may make?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Helen grew more and more uneasy, for she was not clear that she did
      know how it was, with herself at least. Her conscience faltered, and she
      was not sure whether she was alarmed with or without reason. She began to
      compare feelings that she had read of, and feelings that she had seen in
      others, and feelings that were new to herself, and in this maze and mist
      nothing was distinct&mdash;much was magnified&mdash;all alarming.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day Beauclerc was within view of the windows on horseback, on a very
      spirited horse, which he managed admirably; but a shot fired suddenly in
      an adjoining preserve so startled the horse that it&mdash;&mdash;oh! what
      it did Helen did not see, she was so terrified: and why was she so much
      terrified? She excused herself by saying it was natural to be frightened
      for any human creature. But, on the other hand, Tom Isdall was a human
      creature, and she had seen him last week actually thrown from his horse,
      and had not felt much concern. But then he was not a friend; and he fell
      into a soft ditch: and there was something ridiculous in it which
      prevented people from caring about it. With such nice casuistry she went
      on pretty well; and besides, she was so innocent&mdash;so ignorant, that
      it was easy for her to be deceived. She went on, telling herself that she
      loved Beauclerc as a brother&mdash;as she loved the general. But when she
      came to comparisons, she could not but perceive a difference. Her heart
      never bounded on the general&rsquo;s appearance, let him appear ever so
      suddenly, as it did one day when Beauclerc returned unexpectedly from Old
      Forest. Her whole existence seemed so altered by his approach, his
      presence, or his absence. Why was this? Was there any thing wrong in it?
      She had nobody whose judgment she could consult&mdash;nobody to whom she
      could venture to describe her feelings, or lay open her doubts and
      scruples. Lady Cecilia would only laugh; and she could not quite trust
      either her judgment or her sincerity, though she knew her affection.
      Besides, after what Cecilia had said of her being safe; after all she had
      told her of Beauclerc&rsquo;s engagement, how astonished and shocked Cecilia
      would be!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Helen resolved that she would keep a strict watch over herself, and
      repress all emotion, and be severe with her own mind to the utmost: and it
      was upon this resolution that she had changed her manner, without knowing
      how much, towards Beauclerc; she was certain he meant nothing but
      friendship. It was her fault if she felt too much pleasure in his company;
      the same things were, as she wisely argued, right or wrong according to
      the intention with which they were said, done, looked, or felt. Rigidly
      she inflicted on herself the penance of avoiding his delightful society,
      and to make sure that she did not try to attract, she repelled him with
      all her power&mdash;thought she never could make herself cold, and stiff,
      and disagreeable enough to satisfy her conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she grew frightened at Beauclerc&rsquo;s looks of astonishment&mdash;feared
      he would ask explanation&mdash;avoided him more and more. Then, on the
      other hand, she feared he might guess and interpret <i>wrong</i>, or
      rather <i>right</i>, this change; and back she changed, tried in vain to
      keep the just medium&mdash;she had lost the power of measuring&mdash;altogether
      she was very unhappy, and so was Beauclerc; he found her incomprehensible,
      and thought her capricious. His own mind was fluttered with love, so that
      he could not see or judge distinctly, else he might have seen the truth;
      and sometimes, though free from conceit, he did hope it might be all love.
      But why then so determined to discourage him? he had advanced sufficiently
      to mark his intentions, she could not doubt his sincerity. He would see
      farther before he ventured farther. He thought a man was a fool who
      proposed before he had tolerable reason to believe he should not be
      refused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Beltravers and his sisters were now expected at Old Forest
      immediately, and Beauclerc went thither early every morning, to press
      forward the preparations for the arrival of the family, and he seldom
      returned till dinner-time; and every evening Lady Castlefort contrived to
      take possession of him. It appeared to be indeed as much against his will
      as it could be between a well-bred man and a high-bred belle; but to do
      her bidding, seemed if not a moral, at least a polite necessity. She had
      been spoiled, she owned, by foreign attentions, not French, for that is
      all gone now at Paris, but Italian manners, which she so much preferred.
      She did not know how she could live out of Italy, and she must convince
      Lord Castlefort that the climate was necessary for her health. Meanwhile
      she adopted, she acted, what she conceived to be foreign manners, and with
      an exaggeration common with those who have very little sense and a vast
      desire to be fashionable with a certain set. Those who knew her best (all
      but her sister Katrine, who shook her head,) were convinced that there was
      really no harm in Lady Castlefort, &ldquo;only vanity and folly.&rdquo; How frequently
      folly leads farther than fools ever, or wise people often foresee, we need
      not here stop to record. On the present occasion, all at Clarendon Park,
      even those most inclined to scandal, persons who, by the by, may be always
      known by their invariable preface of, &ldquo;I hate all scandal,&rdquo; agreed that
      &ldquo;no one <i>so far</i> could behave better than Granville Beauclerc&mdash;so
      far,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;as yet.&rdquo; But all the elderly who had any experience of this
      world, all the young who had any intuitive prescience in these matters,
      could not but fear that things could not long go on as they were now
      going. It was sadly to be feared that so young a man, and so very handsome
      a man, and such an admirer of beauty, and grace, and music, and of such an
      enthusiastic temper, must be in danger of being drawn on farther than he
      was aware, and before he knew what he was about.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general heard and saw all that went on without seeming to take heed,
      only once he asked Cecilia how long she thought her cousins would stay.
      She did not know, but she said &ldquo;she saw he wished them to be what they
      were not&mdash;cousins once removed&mdash;and quite agreed with him.&rdquo; He
      smiled, for a man is always well pleased to find his wife agree with him
      in disliking her cousins.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night&mdash;one fine moonlight night&mdash;Lady Castlefort, standing
      at the conservatory door with Beauclerc, after talking an inconceivable
      quantity of nonsense about her passion for the moon, and her notions about
      the stars, and congenial souls born under the same planet, proposed to him
      a moonlight walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general was at the time playing at chess with Helen, and had the best
      of the game, but at that moment he made a false move, was check-mated,
      rose hastily, threw the men together on the board, and forgot to regret
      his shameful defeat, or to compliment Helen upon her victory. Lady
      Castlefort, having just discovered that the fatality nonsense about the
      stars would not quite do for Beauclerc, had been the next instant seized
      with a sudden passion for astronomy; she must see those charming rings of
      Saturn, which she had heard so much of, which the general was showing Miss
      Stanley the other night; she must beg him to lend his telescope; she came
      up with her sweetest smile to trouble the general for his glass. Lord
      Castlefort, following, objected strenuously to her going out at night; she
      had been complaining of a bad cold when he wanted her to walk in the
      daytime, she would only make it worse by going out in the night air. If
      she wanted to see Saturn and his rings, the general, he was sure, would
      fix a telescope at the window for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that would not do, she must have a moonlight walk; she threw open the
      conservatory door, beckoned to Mr. Beauclerc, and how it ended Helen did
      not stay to see. She thought that she ought not even to think on the
      subject, and she went away as fast as she could. It was late, and she went
      to bed wishing to be up early, to go on with a drawing she was to finish
      for Mrs. Collingwood&mdash;a view by the river side, that view which had
      struck her fancy as so beautiful the day she went first to Old Forest.
      Early the next morning&mdash;and a delightful morning it was&mdash;she was
      up and out, and reached the spot from which her sketch was taken. She was
      surprised to find her little camp-stool, which she had looked for in vain
      in the hall, in its usual place, set here ready for her, and on it a
      pencil nicely cut.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauclerc must have done this. But he was not in general an early riser.
      However, she concluded that he had gone over thus early to Old Forest, to
      see his friend Lord Beltravers, who was to have arrived the day before,
      with his sisters. She saw a boat rowing down the river, and she had no
      doubt he was gone. But just as she had settled to her drawing, she heard
      the joyful bark of Beauclerc&rsquo;s dog Nelson, who came bounding towards her,
      and the next moment his master appeared, coming down the path from the
      wood. With quick steps he came till he was nearly close to her, then
      slackened his pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning!&rdquo; said Helen; she tried to speak with composure, but her
      heart beat&mdash;she could not help feeling surprise at seeing him&mdash;but
      it was only surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you were gone to Old Forest?&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice sounded different from usual, and she saw in him some suppressed
      agitation. She endeavoured to keep her own manner unembarrassed&mdash;she
      thanked him for the nicely-cut pencil, and the exactly well-placed seat.
      He advanced a step or two nearer, stooped, and looked close at her
      drawing, but he did not seem to see or know what he was looking at.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Nelson, who had been too long unnoticed, put up one paw on
      Miss Stanley&rsquo;s arm, unseen by his master, and encouraged by such gentle
      reproof as Helen gave, his audacious paw was on the top of her
      drawing-book the next moment, and the next was upon the drawing&mdash;and
      the paw was wet with dew.&mdash;&ldquo;Nelson!&rdquo; exclaimed his master in an angry
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O do not scold him,&rdquo; cried Helen, &ldquo;do not punish him; the drawing is not
      spoiled&mdash;only wet, and it will be as well as ever when it is dry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beauclerc ejaculated something about the temper of an angel while she
      patted Nelson&rsquo;s penitent head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As the drawing must be left to dry,&rdquo; said Beauclerc, &ldquo;perhaps Miss
      Stanley would do me the favour to walk as far as the landing-place, where
      the boat is to meet me&mdash;to take me&mdash;if&mdash;if I MUST go to Old
      Forest!&rdquo; and he sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took his offered arm and walked on&mdash;surprised&mdash;confused;&mdash;wondering
      what he meant by that sigh and that look&mdash;and that strong emphasis on
      <i>must</i>. &ldquo;If I <i>must</i> go to Old Forest.&rdquo; Was not it a pleasure?&mdash;was
      it not his own choice?&mdash;what could he mean?&mdash;What could be the
      matter?
    </p>
    <p>
      A vague agitating idea rose in her mind, but she put it from her, and they
      walked on for some minutes, both silent. They entered the wood, and
      feeling the silence awkward, and afraid that he should perceive her
      embarrassment, and that he should suspect her suspicion, she exerted
      herself to speak&mdash;to say something, no matter what.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a charming morning!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a pause of absence of mind, he answered,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charming!&mdash;very!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then stopping short, he fixed his eyes upon Helen with an expression that
      she was afraid to understand. It could hardly bear any interpretation but
      one&mdash;and yet that was impossible&mdash;ought to be impossible&mdash;from
      a man in Beauclerc&rsquo;s circumstances&mdash;engaged&mdash;almost a married
      man, as she had been told to consider him. She did not know at this moment
      what to think&mdash;still she thought she must mistake him, and she should
      be excessively ashamed of such a mistake, and now more strongly felt the
      dread that he should see and misinterpret or interpret too rightly her
      emotion; she walked on quicker, and her breath grew short, and her colour
      heightened. He saw her agitation&mdash;a delightful hope arose in his
      mind. It was plain she was not indifferent&mdash;he looked at her, but
      dared not look long enough&mdash;feared that he was mistaken. But the
      embarrassment seemed to change its character even as he looked, and now it
      was more like displeasure&mdash;decidedly, she appeared displeased. And so
      she was; for she thought now that he must either be trifling with her, or,
      if serious, must be acting most dishonourably;&mdash;her good opinion of
      him must be destroyed for ever, if, as now it seemed, he wished to make an
      impression upon her heart&mdash;yet still she tried not to think, not to
      see it. She was sorry, she was very wrong to let such an idea into her
      mind&mdash;and still her agitation increased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quick as she turned from him these thoughts passed in her mind,
      alternately angry and ashamed, and at last, forcing herself to be
      composed, telling herself she ought to see farther and at least to be
      certain before she condemned him&mdash;condemned so kind, so honourable a
      friend, while the fault might be all her own; she now, in a softened tone,
      as if begging pardon for the pain she had given, and the injustice she had
      done him, said some words, insignificant in themselves, but from the voice
      of kindness charming to Beauclerc&rsquo;s ear and soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are not we walking very fast?&rdquo; said she, breathless. He slackened his
      pace instantly, and with a delighted look, while she, in a hurried voice,
      added, &ldquo;But do not let me delay you. There is the boat. You must be in
      haste&mdash;impatient!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In haste! impatient! to leave you, Helen!&rdquo; She blushed deeper than he had
      ever seen her blush before. Beauclerc in general knew&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">  &ldquo;Which blush was anger&rsquo;s, which was love&rsquo;s!&rdquo;<br /></pre>
    <p>
      &mdash;But now he was so much moved he could not decide at the first
      glance: at the second, there was no doubt; it was anger&mdash;not love.
      Her arm was withdrawn from his. He was afraid he had gone too far. He had
      called her Helen! He begged pardon, half humbly, half proudly. &ldquo;I beg
      pardon; Miss Stanley, I should have said. I see I have offended. I fear I
      have been presumptuous, but Lady Davenant taught me to trust to Miss
      Stanley&rsquo;s sincerity, and I was encouraged by her expressions of confidence
      and friendship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friendship! Oh, yes! Mr. Beauclerc,&rdquo; said Helen, in a hurried voice,
      eagerly seizing on and repeating the word friendship; &ldquo;yes, I have always
      considered you as a friend. I am sure I shall always find you a sincere,
      good friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend!&rdquo; he repeated in a disappointed tone&mdash;all his hopes sunk. She
      took his arm again, and he was displeased even with that. She was not the
      being of real sensibility he had fancied&mdash;she was not capable of real
      love. So vacillated his heart and his imagination, and so quarrelled he
      alternately every instant with her and with himself. He could not
      understand her, or decide what he should next do or say himself; and there
      was the boat nearing the land, and they were going on, on, towards it in
      silence. He sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a sigh that could not but be heard and noticed; it was not meant to
      be noticed, and yet it was. What could she think of it? She could not
      believe that Beauclerc meant to act treacherously. This time she was
      determined not to take anything for granted, not to be so foolish as she
      had been with Mr. Churchill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is not that your boat that I see, rowing close?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I believe&mdash;certainly. Yes,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now the vacillation of Beauclerc&rsquo;s mind suddenly ceased. Desperate, he
      stopped her, as she would have turned down that path to the landing-place
      where the boat was mooring. He stood full across the path. &ldquo;Miss Stanley,
      one word&mdash;by one word, one look decide. You must decide for me
      whether I stay&mdash;or go&mdash;for ever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I!&mdash;Mr. Beauclerc!&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The look of astonishment&mdash;more than astonishment, almost of
      indignation&mdash;silenced him completely, and he stood dismayed. She
      pressed onwards, and he no longer stopped her path. For an instant he
      submitted in despair. &ldquo;Then I must not think of it. I must go&mdash;must
      I, Miss Stanley? Will not you listen to me, Helen? Advise me; let me open
      my heart to you as a friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped under the shady tree beneath which they were passing, and,
      leaning against it, she repeated, &ldquo;As a friend&mdash;but, no, no, Mr.
      Beauclerc&mdash;no; I am not the friend you should consult&mdash;consult
      the general, your guardian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have consulted him, and he approves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have! That is well, that is well at all events,&rdquo; cried she; &ldquo;if he
      approves, then all is right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a ray of satisfaction on her countenance. He looked as if
      considering what she exactly meant. He hoped again, and was again resolved
      to hazard the decisive words. &ldquo;If you knew all!&rdquo; and he pressed her arm
      closer to him&mdash;&ldquo;if I might tell you all&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen withdrew her arm decidedly. &ldquo;I know all,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;all I ought to
      know, Mr. Beauclerc.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know all!&rdquo; cried he, astonished at her manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know the circumstances in which I am placed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He alluded to the position in which he stood with Lady Castlefort; she
      thought he meant with respect to Lady Blanche, and she answered&mdash;&ldquo;Yes:
      I know all!&rdquo; and her eye turned towards the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand you,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;you think I ought to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said she. It never entered into her mind to doubt the truth
      of what Lady Cecilia had told her, and she had at first been so much
      embarrassed by the fear of betraying what she felt she ought not to feel,
      and she was now so shocked by what she thought his dishonourable conduct,
      that she repeated almost in a tone of severity&mdash;&ldquo;Certainly, Mr.
      Beauclerc, you ought to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words, &ldquo;since you are engaged,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;you know you are engaged,&rdquo; she
      was on the point of adding, but Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s injunctions not to tell him
      that she had betrayed his secret stopped her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her for an instant, and then abruptly, and in great
      agitation, said; &ldquo;May I ask, Miss Stanley, if your affections are
      engaged?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that a question, Mr. Beauclerc, which you have a right to ask me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no right&mdash;no right, I acknowledge&mdash;I am answered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned away from her, and ran down the bank towards the boat, but
      returned instantly, and exclaimed, &ldquo;If you say to me, go! I am gone for
      ever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go!&rdquo; Helen firmly pronounced. &ldquo;You never can be more than a friend to me!
      Oh never be less!&mdash;go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am gone,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you shall never see me more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went, and a few seconds afterwards she heard the splashing of his oars.
      He was gone! Oh! how she wished that they had parted sooner&mdash;a few
      minutes sooner, even before he had so looked&mdash;so spoken!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! that we had parted while I might have still perfectly esteemed him;
      but now&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Helen attempted to walk, she trembled so much that she could not
      move, and leaning against the tree under which she was standing, she
      remained fixed for some time almost without thought. Then she began to
      recollect what had been before all this, and as soon as she could walk she
      went back for her drawing-book, threw from her the pencil which Beauclerc
      had cut, and made her way home as fast as she could, and up to her own
      room, without meeting anybody; and as soon as she was there she bolted the
      door and threw herself upon her bed. She had by this time a dreadful
      headache, and she wanted to try and get rid of it in time for breakfast&mdash;that
      was her first object; but her thoughts were so confused that they could
      not fix upon anything rightly. She tried to compose herself, and to think
      the whole affair over again; but she could not. There was something so
      strange in what had passed! The sudden&mdash;the total change in her
      opinion&mdash;her total loss of confidence! She tried to put all thoughts
      and feelings out of her mind, and just to lie stupified if she could, that
      she might get rid of the pain in her head. She had no idea whether it was
      late or early, and was going to get up to look at her watch, when she
      heard the first bell, half an hour before breakfast, and this was the time
      when Cecilia usually opened the door between their rooms. She dreaded the
      sound, but when she had expected it some minutes, she became impatient
      even for that which she feared; she wanted to have it over, and she raised
      herself on her elbow, and listened with acute impatience: at last the door
      was thrown wide open, and bright and gay as ever, in came Cecilia, but at
      the first sight of Helen on her bed, wan and miserable, she stopped short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dearest Helen! what can be the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Beauclerc&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! what of him?&rdquo; cried Cecilia, and she smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Cecilia! do not smile; you cannot imagine&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! but I can,&rdquo; cried Cecilia. &ldquo;I see how it is; I understand it
      all; and miserable and amazed as you look at this moment, I will set all
      right for you in one word. He is not going to be married&mdash;not
      engaged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen started up. &ldquo;Not engaged!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more than you are, my dear! Oh! I am glad to see your colour come
      again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank Heaven!&rdquo; cried Helen, &ldquo;then he is not&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A villain!&mdash;not at all. He is all that&rsquo;s right; all that is
      charming, my dear. So thank Heaven, and be as happy as you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I cannot understand it,&rdquo; said Helen, sinking back; &ldquo;I really cannot
      understand how it is, Cecilia.&rdquo; Cecilia gave her a glass of water in great
      haste, and was very sorry, and very glad, and begged forgiveness, and all
      in a breath: but as yet Helen did not know what she had to forgive, till
      it was explained to her in direct words, that Cecilia had told her not
      only what was not true, but what she at the time of telling knew to be
      false.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what purpose, oh! my dear Cecilia! All to save me from a little
      foolish embarrassment at first, you have made us miserable at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miserable! my dear Helen; at worst miserable only for half an hour.
      Nonsense! lie down again, and rest your poor head. I will go this minute
      to Granville. Where is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone! Gone for ever! Those were his last words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible! absurd! Only what a man says in a passion. But where is he
      gone? Only to Old Forest! Gone for ever&mdash;gone till dinner-time!
      Probably coming back at this moment in all haste, like a true lover, to
      beg your pardon for your having used him abominably ill. Now, smile; do
      not shake your head, and look so wretched; but tell me exactly, word for
      word and look for look, all that passed between you, and then I shall know
      what is best to be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Word for word Helen could not answer, for she had been so much confused,
      but she told to the best of her recollection; and Cecilia still thought no
      great harm was done. She only looked a little serious from the
      apprehension, now the real, true apprehension, of what might happen about
      Lady Blanche, who, as she believed, was at Old Forest. &ldquo;Men are so
      foolish; men in love, so rash. Beauclerc, in a fit of anger and despair on
      being so refused by the woman he loved, might go and throw himself at the
      feet of another for whom he did not care in the least, in a strange sort
      of revenge. But I know how to settle it all, and I will do it this
      moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Helen caught hold of her hand, and firmly detaining it, absolutely
      objected to her doing anything without telling her exactly and truly what
      she was going to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia assured her that she was only going to inquire from the
      general whether Lady Blanche was with her sister at Old Forest, or not.
      &ldquo;Listen to me, my dear Helen; what I am going to say can do no mischief.
      If Lady Blanche is there, then the best thing to be done is, for me to go
      immediately, this very morning, to pay the ladies a visit on their coming
      to the country, and I will bring back Granville. A word will bring him
      back. I will only tell him there was a little mistake, or if you think it
      best, I will tell him the whole truth. Let me go&mdash;only let me go and
      consult the general before the breakfast-bell rings, for I shall have no
      time afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen let her go, for as Beauclerc had told her that he had opened his
      mind to the general, she thought it was best that he should hear all that
      had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment the general saw Lady Cecilia come in, he smiled, and said,
      &ldquo;Well! my dear Cecilia, you have seen Helen this morning, and she has seen
      Beauclerc&mdash;what is the result? Does he stay, or go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is gone!&rdquo; said Cecilia. The general looked surprised and sorry. &ldquo;He
      did not propose for her,&rdquo; continued Cecilia, &ldquo;he did not declare himself&mdash;he
      only began to sound her opinion of him, and she&mdash;she contrived to
      misunderstand&mdash;to offend him, and he is gone, but only to Old Forest,
      and we can have him back again directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not likely,&rdquo; said the general, &ldquo;because I know that Beauclerc had
      determined, that if he went he would not return for some time. Your friend
      Helen was to decide. If she gave him any hope, that is, permitted him to
      appear as her declared admirer, he could, with propriety, happiness, and
      honour, remain here; if not, my dear Cecilia, you must be sensible that he
      is right to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone for some time!&rdquo; repeated Cecilia, &ldquo;you mean as long as Lady
      Castlefort is here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish she was gone, I am sure, with all my heart,&rdquo; said Cecilia; &ldquo;but in
      the mean time, tell me, my dear Clarendon, do you know whether Lord
      Beltravers&rsquo; sisters are at Old Forest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general did not think that Lady Blanche had arrived; he was not
      certain, but he knew that the Comtesse de St. Cymon had arrived yesterday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;it would be but civil to go to see the comtesse. I
      will go this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      General Clarendon answered instantly, and with decision, that she must not
      think of such a thing&mdash;that it could not be done. &ldquo;Madame de St.
      Cymon is a woman of doubtful reputation, not a person with whom Lady
      Cecilia Clarendon ought to form any acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not form an acquaintance&mdash;I&rsquo;m quite aware of that,&rdquo; and eagerly
      she pleaded that she had no intention of doing anything; &ldquo;but just one
      morning visit paid and returned, you know, leads to nothing. Probably we
      shall neither of us be at home, and never meet; and really it would be
      such a marked thing not to pay this visit to the Beltravers family on
      their return to the country. Formerly there was such a good understanding
      between the Forresters and your father; and really hospitality requires
      it. Altogether this one visit really must be paid, it cannot be helped, so
      I will order the carriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must not be done!&rdquo; the general said; &ldquo;it is a question of right, not
      of expediency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right, but there is nothing really wrong, surely; I believe all that has
      been said of her is scandal. Nobody is safe against reports&mdash;the
      public papers are so scandalous! While a woman lives with her husband, it
      is but charitable to suppose all is right. That&rsquo;s the rule. Besides, we
      should not throw the first stone.&rdquo; Then Lady Cecilia pleaded, lady this
      and lady that, and the whole county, without the least scruple would visit
      Madame de St. Cymon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady this and lady that may do as they please, or as their husbands think
      proper or improper, that is no rule for Lady Cecilia Clarendon; and as to
      the whole county, or the whole world, what is that to me, when I have
      formed my own determination?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fact was, that at this very time Madame de St. Cymon was about to be
      separated from her husband. A terrible discovery had just been made. Lord
      Beltravers had brought his sister to Old Forest to bide her from London
      disgrace; there he intended to leave her to rusticate, while he should
      follow her husband to Paris immediately, to settle the terms of separation
      or divorce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beauclerc, no doubt, will go to Paris with him,&rdquo; said the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Paris! when will he set out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day&mdash;directly, if Helen has decidedly rejected him; but you say
      he did not declare himself. Pray tell me all at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And if she had done so, all might have been well; but she was afraid. Her
      husband was as exact about <i>some things</i> as her mother; he would
      certainly be displeased at the deception she had practised on Helen; she
      could not tell him that, not at this moment, for she had just fooled him
      to the top of his bent about this visit; she would find a better time; she
      so dreaded the instant change of his smile&mdash;the look of
      disapprobation; she was so cowardly; in short, the present pain of
      displeasing&mdash;the consequences even of her own folly, she never could
      endure, and to avoid it she had always recourse to some new evasion; and
      now, when Helen&mdash;her dear Helen&rsquo;s happiness, was at stake, she
      faltered&mdash;she paltered&mdash;she would not for the world do her any
      wrong; but still she thought she could manage without telling the whole&mdash;she
      would tell nothing <i>but</i> the truth. So, after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation,
      while all these thoughts went through her mind, when the general repeated
      his question, and begged to know at once what was passing in her little
      head; she smiled in return for that smile which played on her husband&rsquo;s
      face while he fondly looked upon her, and she answered, &ldquo;I am thinking of
      poor Helen. She has made a sad mistake&mdash;and has a horrid headache at
      this moment&mdash;in short she has offended Beauclerc past endurance&mdash;past
      his endurance&mdash;and he went off in a passion before she found out her
      mistake. In short, we must have him back again; could you go, my dear love&mdash;or
      write directly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First let me understand,&rdquo; said the general. &ldquo;Miss Stanley has made a
      mistake&mdash;what mistake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She thought Beauclerc was engaged to Lady Blanche.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could she think so? What reason had she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She had been told so by somebody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody!&mdash;that eternal scandal-monger Lady Katrine, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;not Lady Katrine,&rdquo; said Cecilia; &ldquo;but I am not at liberty to
      tell you whom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter; but Miss Stanley is not a fool; she could not believe somebody
      or anybody, contrary to common sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but Beauclerc did not come quite to proposing&mdash;and you know she
      had been blamed for refusing Mr. Churchill before she was asked&mdash;and
      in short&mdash;in love, people do not always know what they are about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand one word of it,&rdquo; said the general; &ldquo;nor I am sure do
      you, my dear Cecilia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I really do, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Cecilia, I assure you it is always best to let people settle
      their love affairs their own way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, certainly&mdash;I would not interfere in the least&mdash;only to get
      Granville back again&mdash;and then let them settle it their own way.
      Cannot you call at Old Forest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you not write?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;not unless I know the whole. I will do nothing in the dark.
      Always tell your confessor, your lawyer, your physician, your friend, your
      whole case, or they are fools or rogues if they act for you; go back and
      repeat this to Helen Stanley from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear, she will think it so unkind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let her show me how I can serve her, and I will do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only write a line to Beauclerc&mdash;say, &lsquo;Beauclerc come back,&mdash;here
      has been a mistake.&rsquo;&rdquo; She would have put a pen into his hand, and held
      paper to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me know the whole, and then, and not till then, can I judge whether I
      should be doing right for her or not.&rdquo; The difficulty of telling the whole
      had increased to Lady Cecilia, even from the hesitation and prevarication
      she had now made. &ldquo;Let me see Helen,&mdash;let me speak to her myself, and
      learn what this strange nonsensical mystery is.&rdquo; He was getting impatient.
      &ldquo;Cannot I see Miss Stanley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why no, my dear love, not just now, she has such a headache! She is lying
      down. There is the breakfast-bell&mdash;after breakfast, if you please.
      But I am clear she would rather not speak to you herself on the subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then come down to breakfast, my dear, and let her settle it her own way&mdash;that
      is much the best plan. Interference in love matters always does mischief.
      Come to breakfast, my dear&mdash;I have no time to lose&mdash;I must be
      off to a court-martial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at his watch, and Cecilia went half down stairs with him, and
      then ran back to keep Helen quiet by the assurance that all would be
      settled&mdash;all would be right, and that she would send her up some
      breakfast&mdash;she must not think of coming down; and Cecilia lamented
      half breakfast-time&mdash;how subject to headaches poor Helen was; and
      through this and through all other conversation she settled what she would
      do for her. As the last resource, she would tell the whole truth&mdash;not
      to her husband, she loved him too well to face his displeasure for one
      moment&mdash;but to Beauclerc; and writing would be so much easier than
      speaking&mdash;without being put to the blush she could explain it all to
      Beauclerc, and turn it playfully; and he would be so happy that he would
      be only too glad to forgive her, and to do anything she asked. She
      concocted and wrote a very pretty letter, in which she took all the blame
      fully on herself&mdash;did perfect justice to Helen; said she wrote
      without her knowledge, and depended entirely upon his discretion, so he
      must come back of his own accord, and keep her counsel. This letter,
      however, she could not despatch so soon as she had expected; she could not
      send a servant with it till the general should be off to his
      court-martial. Now had Cecilia gone the straight-forward way to work, her
      husband could in that interval, and would, have set all to rights; but
      this to Cecilia was impossible; she could only wait in an agony of
      impatience till the general and his officers were all out of the way, and
      then she despatched a groom with her letter to Old Forest, and desired him
      to return as fast as possible, while she went to Helen&rsquo;s room, to while
      away the time of anxious suspense as well as she could; and she soon
      succeeded in talking herself into excellent spirits again. &ldquo;Now, my dear
      Helen, if that unlucky mistake had not been made,&mdash;if you had not
      fancied that Granville was married already,&mdash;and if he had actually
      proposed for you,&mdash;what would you have said?&mdash;in short&mdash;would
      you have accepted him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Cecilia, I do hope he will understand how it all was; I hope he will
      believe that I esteem him as I always did: as to love&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen paused, and Lady Cecilia went on: &ldquo;As to love, nobody knows anything
      about it till it comes&mdash;and here it is coming, I do believe!&rdquo;
       continued she, looking out of the window.&mdash;No! not Mr. Beauclerc, but
      the man she had sent with her letter, galloping towards the house.
      Disappointed not to see Beauclerc himself, she could only conclude that as
      he had not his horse with him, he was returning in the boat. The answer to
      her letter was brought in. At the first glance on the direction, her
      countenance changed. &ldquo;Not Granville&rsquo;s hand!&mdash;what can have happened?&rdquo;
       She tore open the note, &ldquo;He is gone!&mdash;gone with Lord Beltravers&mdash;set
      off!&mdash;gone to Paris!&rdquo; Helen said not one word, and Cecilia, in
      despair, repeated, &ldquo;Gone!&mdash;gone!&mdash;absolutely gone! Nothing more
      can be done. Oh, that I had done nothing about it! All has failed! Heaven
      knows what may happen now! Oh! if I could but have let it all alone! I
      never, never can forgive myself! My dear Helen, be angry with me&mdash;reproach
      me: pray&mdash;pray reproach me as I deserve!&rdquo; But Helen could not blame
      one who so blamed herself&mdash;one who, however foolish and wrong she had
      been, had done it all from the kindest motives. In the agony of her
      penitence, she now told Helen all that had passed between her and the
      general; that, to avoid the shame of confessing to him her first
      deception, she had gone on another and another step in these foolish
      evasions, contrivances, and mysteries; how, thinking she could manage it,
      she had written without his knowledge; and now, to complete her
      punishment, not only had every thing which she had attempted failed, but a
      consequence which she could never have foreseen had happened.&mdash;&ldquo;Here
      I am, with a note actually in my hand from this horrid Madame de St.
      Cymon, whom Clarendon absolutely would not hear of my even calling upon!
      Look what she writes to me. She just took advantage of this opportunity to
      begin a correspondence before an acquaintance: but I will never answer
      her. Here is what she says:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The Comtesse de St. Cymon exceedingly regrets that Lady Cecilia
      Clarendon&rsquo;s servant did not arrive in time to deliver her ladyship&rsquo;s
      letter into Mr. Beauclerc&rsquo;s own hand. Mr. B. left Old Forest with Lord
      Beltravers early to-day for Paris. The Comtesse de St. Cymon,
      understanding that Lady Cecilia Clarendon is anxious that there should be
      as little delay as possible in forwarding her letter, and calculating that
      if returned by her ladyship&rsquo;s servant it must be too late for this day&rsquo;s
      post from Clarendon Park, has forwarded it immediately with her own
      letters to Paris, which cannot fail to meet Mr. Beauclerc directly on his
      arrival there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Lady Cecilia, &ldquo;how angry the general would be if he knew of
      this!&rdquo; She tore the note to the smallest bits as she spoke, and threw them
      away; and next she begged that Helen would never say a word about it.
      There was no use in telling the general what would only vex him, and what
      could not be helped; and what could lead to nothing, for she should never
      answer this note, nor have any further communication of any kind with
      Madame de St. Cymon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen, nevertheless, thought it would be much better to tell the general
      of it, and she wondered how Cecilia could think of doing otherwise, and
      just when she had so strongly reproached herself, and repented of these
      foolish mysteries; and this was going on another step. &ldquo;Indeed, Cecilia,&rdquo;
       said Helen, &ldquo;I wish&mdash;on my own account I wish you would not conceal
      anything. It is hard to let the general suspect me of extreme folly and
      absurdity, or of some sort of double dealing in this business, in which I
      have done my utmost to do right and to go straightforward.&rdquo; Poor Helen,
      with her nervous headache beating worse and worse, remonstrated and
      entreated, and came to tears; and Lady Cecilia promised that it should be
      all done as she desired; but again she charged and besought Helen to say
      nothing herself about the matter to the general: and this acceded to, Lady
      Cecilia&rsquo;s feelings being as transient as they were vehement, all her
      self-reproaches, penitence, and fears passed away, and, taking her bright
      view of the whole affair, she ended with the certainty that Beauclerc,
      would return the moment he received her letter; that he would have it in a
      very few days, and all would end well, and quite as well as if she had not
      been a fool.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE first tidings of Beauclerc came in a letter from him to the general,
      written immediately after his arrival at Paris. But it was plain that it
      must have been written before Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s letter, forwarded by Madame
      de St. Cymon, could have reached him. It was evident that matters were as
      yet unexplained, from his manner of writing about &ldquo;the death-blow to all
      his hopes,&rdquo; and now he was setting off with Lord Beltravers for Naples, to
      follow M. de St. Cymon, and settle the business of the sister&rsquo;s divorce.
      Lady Cecilia could only hope that her letter would follow him thither,
      enclosed in this Madame de St. Cymon&rsquo;s despatches to her brother; and now
      they could know nothing more till they could hear from Naples.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Helen perceived that, though the general continued to be as
      attentive and kind to her as usual, yet that there was something more
      careful and reserved in his manner than formerly, less of spontaneous
      regard, and cordial confidence. It was not that he was displeased by her
      having discouraged the addresses of his ward, fond as he was of Beauclerc,
      and well as he would have been pleased by the match. This he distinctly
      expressed the only time that he touched upon the subject. He said, that
      Miss Stanley was the best and the only judge of what would make her happy;
      but he could not comprehend the nature of the mistake she had made;
      Cecilia&rsquo;s explanations, whatever they were, had not made the matter clear.
      There was either some caprice, or some mystery, which he determined not to
      inquire into, upon his own principle of leaving people to settle their
      love affairs in their own way. Helen&rsquo;s spirits were lowered: naturally of
      great sensibility, she depended more for her happiness on her inward
      feelings than upon any external circumstances. A great deal of gaiety was
      now going on constantly among the young people at Clarendon Park, and this
      made her want of spirits more disagreeable to herself, more obvious, and
      more observed by others. Lady Katrine rallied her unmercifully. Not
      suspecting the truth, her ladyship presumed that Miss Stanley repented of
      having, before she was asked, said No instead of Yes, to Mr. Churchill.
      Ever since his departure she had evidently worn the willow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia was excessively vexed by this ill-natured raillery: conscious
      that she had been the cause of all this annoyance to Helen, and of much
      more serious evil to her, the zeal and tenderness of her affection now
      increased, and was shown upon every little occasion involuntarily, in a
      manner that continually irritated her cousin Katrine&rsquo;s jealousy. Helen had
      been used to live only with those by whom she was beloved, and she was not
      at all prepared for the sort of warfare which Lady Katrine carried on; her
      perpetual sneers, innuendoes, and bitter sarcasms, Helen did not resent,
      but she felt them. The arrows, ill-aimed and weak, could not penetrate
      far; it was not with their point they wounded, but by their venom&mdash;wherever
      that touched it worked inward mischief. Often to escape from one false
      imputation she exposed herself to another more grievous. One night, when
      the young people wished to dance, and the usual music was not to be had,
      Helen played quadrilles, and waltzes, for hours with indefatigable
      good-nature, and when some of the party returned their cordial thanks,
      Lady Katrine whispered, &ldquo;our musician has been well paid by Lord
      Estridge&rsquo;s admiration of her white hands.&rdquo; His lordship had not danced,
      and had been standing all the evening beside Helen, much to the
      discomfiture of Lady Katrine, who intended to have had him for her own
      partner. The next night, Helen did not play, but joined the dance, and
      with a boy partner, whom nobody could envy her. The general, who saw
      wonderfully quickly the by-play of society, marked all this, and now his
      eye followed Helen through the quadrille, and he said to some one standing
      by, that Miss Stanley danced charmingly, to his taste, and in such a
      lady-like manner. He was glad to see her in good spirits again; her colour
      was raised, and he observed that she looked remarkably well. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Lady
      Katrine answered, &ldquo;remarkably well; and black is so becoming to that sort
      of complexion, no doubt this is the reason Miss Stanley wears it so much
      longer than is customary for an uncle. Short or long mournings are, to be
      sure, just according to fashion, or feeling, as some say. For my part, I
      hate long mournings&mdash;so like ostentation of sentiment; whatever I
      did, at any rate I would be consistent. I never would dance in black.
      Pope, you know, has such a good cut at that sort of thing. Do you
      recollect the lines?&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> &ldquo;&lsquo;And bear about the mockery of woe<br />  To midnight dances and the public show.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></pre>
    <p>
      Lady Castlefort took Miss Stanley aside, after the dance was over, to
      whisper to her so good-naturedly, how shockingly severe Katrine had been;
      faithfully repeating every word that her sister had said. &ldquo;And so cruel,
      to talk of your bearing about the <i>mockery</i> of woe!&mdash;But, my
      sweet little lamb, do not let me distress you so.&rdquo; Helen, withdrawing from
      the false caresses of Lady Castlefort, assured her that she should not be
      hurt by any thing Lady Katrine could say, as she so little understood her
      real feelings; and at the moment her spirit rose against the injustice,
      and felt as much superior to such petty malice as even Lady Davenant could
      have desired. She had resolved to continue in mourning for the longest
      period in which it is worn for a parent, because, in truth, her uncle had
      been a parent to her; but the morning after Lady Katrine&rsquo;s cruel remarks,
      Cecilia begged that Helen would oblige her by laying aside black. &ldquo;Let it
      be on my birthday.&rdquo; Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s birth-day was to be celebrated the
      ensuing week. &ldquo;Well, for that day certainly I will,&rdquo; Helen said; &ldquo;but only
      for that day.&rdquo; This would not satisfy Cecilia. Helen saw that Lady
      Katrine&rsquo;s observations had made a serious impression, and, dreading to
      become the subject of daily observation, perhaps altercation, she yielded.
      The mourning was thrown aside. Then every thing she wore must be new. Lady
      Cecilia and Mademoiselle Felicie, her waiting-maid, insisted upon taking
      the matter into their own hands. Helen really intended only to let one
      dress for her friend&rsquo;s birth-day be bespoken for her; but from one thing
      she was led on to another. Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s taste in dress was exquisite.
      Her first general principle was admirable&mdash;&ldquo;Whatever you buy, let it
      be the best of its kind, which is always the cheapest in the end.&rdquo; Her
      second maxim was&mdash;&ldquo;Never have anything but from such and such people,
      or from such and such places,&rdquo; naming those who were at the moment
      accredited by fashion. &ldquo;These, of course, make you pay high for the name
      of the thing; but that must be. The name is all,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia. &ldquo;Does
      your hat, your bonnet, whatever it be, come from the reigning fashionable
      authority? then it is right, and you are quite right. You can put down all
      objections and objectors with the magic of a name. You need think no more
      about your dress; you have no trouble; while the poor creatures who go
      toiling and rummaging in cheap shops&mdash;what comes of it? but total
      exhaustion and disgrace! Yesterday, now, my dear Helen, recollect. When
      Lady Katrine, after dinner, asked little Miss Isdall where she bought that
      pretty hat, the poor girl was quite out of countenance. &lsquo;Really she did
      not know; she only knew it was very cheap.&rsquo; You saw that nobody could
      endure the hat afterwards; so that, cheap as it might be, it was money to
      all intents and purposes absolutely thrown away, for it did not answer its
      purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen, laughing, observed, that if its purpose had been to look well, and
      to make the wearer look well, it had fully succeeded. &ldquo;Sophistry, my dear
      Helen. The purpose was not to look well, but to have a distinguished air.
      Dress, and what we call fashion and taste altogether, you know, are mere
      matters of opinion, association of ideas, and so forth. When will you
      learn to reason, as mamma says? Do not make me despair of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus, half in jest, half in earnest, with truth and falsehood, sense and
      nonsense, prettily blended together, Lady Cecilia prevailed in
      overpowering Helen&rsquo;s better judgment, and obtained a hasty submission. In
      economy, as in morals, false principles are far more dangerous than any
      one single error. One false principle as to laying out money is worse than
      any bad bargain that can be made, because it leads to bad bargains
      innumerable. It was settled that all Helen wanted should be purchased, not
      only from those who sold the best goods, but from certain very expensive
      houses of fashionably high name in London. And the next point Lady Cecilia
      insisted upon was, that Helen&rsquo;s dress should always be the same as her
      own. &ldquo;You know it used to be so, my dear Helen, when we were children; let
      it be so now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there is such a difference <i>now</i>&rdquo; said Helen; &ldquo;and I cannot
      afford&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Difference! Oh! don&rsquo;t talk of differences&mdash;let there be none ever
      between us. Not afford!&mdash;nonsense, my dear&mdash;the expense will be
      nothing. In these days you get the materials of dress absolutely for
      nothing&mdash;the fashion&mdash;the making-up is all, us Felicie and I,
      and everybody who knows anything of the matter, can tell you. Now all that
      sort of thing we can save you&mdash;here is my wedding paraphernalia all
      at your service&mdash;patterns ready cut&mdash;and here is Felicie, whose
      whole French soul is in the toilette&mdash;and there is your own little
      maid, who has hands, and head, and heart, all devoted to you&mdash;so
      leave it to us&mdash;leave it to us, my dear&mdash;take no thought what
      you shall put on&mdash;and you will put it on all the better.&rdquo; Felicie was
      summoned. &ldquo;Felicie, remember Miss Stanley&rsquo;s dress is always to be the same
      as my own. It must be so, my dear. It will be the greatest pleasure to
      me,&rdquo; and with her most persuasive caressing manner, she added, &ldquo;My own
      dear Helen, if you love me, let it be so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was an appeal which Helen could not resist. She thought that she
      could not refuse without vexing Cecilia; and, from a sort of sentimental
      belief that she was doing Cecilia &ldquo;a real kindness,&rdquo;&mdash;that it was
      what Cecilia called &ldquo;a sisterly act,&rdquo; she yielded to what she knew was
      unsuited to her circumstances&mdash;to what was quite contrary to her
      better judgment. It often so happens, that our friends doubly guard one
      obvious point of weakness, while another exists undiscovered by them, and
      unknown to ourselves. Lady Davenant had warned Helen against the dangers
      of indecision and coquetry with her lovers, but this danger of
      extravagance in dress she had not foreseen&mdash;and into how much expense
      this one weak compliance would lead her, Helen could not calculate. She
      had fancied that, at least, till she went to town, she should not want
      anything expensive&mdash;this was a great mistake. Formerly in England, as
      still in every other country but England, a marked difference was made in
      the style of dress in the country and in town. Formerly, overdressing in
      the country was reprobated as quite vulgar; but now, even persons of birth
      and fashion are guilty of this want of taste and sense. They display
      almost as much expensive dress in the country as in town.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened that, among the succession of company at Clarendon Park this
      summer, there came, self-invited, from the royal party in the
      neighbourhood, a certain wealthy lady, by some called &ldquo;Golconda,&rdquo; by
      others &ldquo;the Duchess of Baubleshire.&rdquo; She was passionately fond of dress,
      and she eclipsed all rivals in magnificence and variety of ornaments. At
      imminent peril of being robbed, she brought to the country, and carried
      about everywhere with her, an amazing number of jewels, wearing two or
      three different sets at different times of the day&mdash;displaying them
      on the most absurdly improper occasions&mdash;at a fete champêtre, or a
      boat race.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once, after a riding-party, at a pic-nic under the trees, when it had been
      resolved unanimously that nobody should change their dress at dinner-time,
      Golconda appeared in a splendid necklace, displayed over her riding-dress,
      and when she was reproached with having broken through the general
      agreement not to dress she replied, that, &ldquo;Really she had put the thing on
      in the greatest hurry, without knowing well what it was, just to oblige
      her little page who had brought three sets of jewels for her choice&mdash;she
      had chosen the <i>most undressed</i> of the three, merely because she
      could not disappoint the poor little fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Every one saw the affectation and folly, and above all, the vulgarity of
      this display, and those who were most envious were most eager to comfort
      themselves by ridicule. Never was the &ldquo;Golconda&rdquo; out of hearing, but Lady
      Katrine was ready with some instance of her &ldquo;absurd vanity.&rdquo; &ldquo;If fortune
      had but blessed her with such jewels,&rdquo; Lady Katrine said, &ldquo;she trusted she
      should have worn them with better grace;&rdquo; but it did not appear that the
      taste for baubles was diminished by the ridicule thrown upon them&mdash;quite
      the contrary, it was plain that the laughers were only envious, and
      envious because they could not be envied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia, who had no envy in her nature&mdash;who was really generous&mdash;entered
      not into this vain competition; on the contrary, she refrained from
      wearing any of her jewels, because Helen had none; besides, simplicity was
      really the best taste, the general said so&mdash;this was well thought and
      well done for some time, but there was a little lurking love of ornaments
      in Cecilia&rsquo;s mind, nor was Helen entirely without sympathy in that taste.
      Her uncle had early excited it in her mind by frequent fond presents of
      the prettiest trinkets imaginable; the taste had been matured along with
      her love for one for whom she had such strong affection, and it had seemed
      to die with its origin. Before she left Cecilhurst, Helen had given away
      every ornament she possessed; she thought she could never want them again,
      and she left them as remembrances with those who had loved her and her
      uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia on her birthday brought her a set of forget-me-nots to match those
      which she intended to wear herself, and which had been long ago given to
      Lady Cecilia by the dear good dean himself. This was irresistible to
      Helen, and they were accepted. But this was only the prelude to presents
      of more value, which Helen scrupled to receive; yet&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">  &ldquo;Oft to refuse and never once offend"<br /></pre>
    <p>
      was not so easily done as said, especially with Lady Cecilia; she was so
      urgent, so caressing, and had so many plausible reasons, suitable to all
      occasions. On the general&rsquo;s birthday, Lady Cecilia naturally wished to
      wear his first gift to her&mdash;a pair of beautiful pearl bracelets, but
      then Helen must have the same. Helen thought that Roman pearl would do
      quite as well for her. She had seen some such excellent imitations that no
      eye could detect the difference. &ldquo;No eye! very likely; but still your own
      conscience, my dear!&rdquo; replied Lady Cecilia. &ldquo;And if people ask whether
      they are real, what could you say? You know there are everywhere
      impertinent people; malicious Lady Katrines, who will ask questions. Oh!
      positively I cannot bear to think of your being detected in passing off
      counterfeits. In all ornaments, it should be genuine or none&mdash;none or
      genuine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None, then, let it be for me this time, dear Cecilia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia seemed to submit, and Helen thought she had well settled it. But
      on the day of the general&rsquo;s <i>fête</i>, the pearl bracelets were on her
      dressing-table. They were from the general, and could not be refused.
      Cecilia declared she had nothing to do with the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Cecilia!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word!&rdquo; cried Lady Cecilia; &ldquo;and if you doubt me, the general
      shall have the honour of presenting, and you the agony of refusing or
      accepting them in full salon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen sighed, hesitated, and submitted. The general, on her appearing with
      the bracelets, bowed, smiled, and thanked her with his kindest look; and
      she was glad to see him look kindly upon her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having gained her point so pleasantly this time, Lady Cecilia did not stop
      there; and Helen found there was no resource but to bespeak beforehand for
      herself whatever she apprehended would be pressed upon her acceptance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fresh occasions for display, and new necessities for expense, continually
      occurred. Reviews, and races, and race-balls, and archery meetings, and
      archery balls, had been, and a regatta was to be. At some of these the
      ladies had appeared in certain uniforms, new, of course, for the day; and
      now preparations for the regatta had commenced, and were going on. It was
      to last several days: and after the boat-races in the morning, there were
      to be balls at night. The first of these was to be at Clarendon Park, and
      Mademoiselle Felicie considered her lady&rsquo;s dress upon this occasion as one
      of the objects of first importance in the universe. She had often sighed
      over the long unopened jewel-box. Her lady might as well be nobody.
      Mademoiselle Felicie could no ways understand a lady well born not wearing
      that which distinguished her above the common; and if she was ever to wear
      jewels, the ball-room was surely the proper place. And the sapphire
      necklace would look <i>à ravir</i> with her lady&rsquo;s dress, which, indeed,
      without it, would have no effect; would be quite <i>mésquine</i> and <i>manquée</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Lady Cecilia had a great inclination to wear that sapphire necklace,
      which probably Felicie saw when she commenced her remonstrances, for it is
      part of the business of the well-trained waiting-woman, to give utterance
      to those thoughts which her lady wishes should be divined and pressed into
      accomplishment. Cecilia considered whether it would not be possible to
      divide the double rows of her sapphires, to make out a set for Helen as
      well as for herself; she hesitated only because they had been given to her
      by her mother, and she did not like to run the hazard of spoiling the set;
      but still she could manage it, and she would do it. Mademoiselle Felicie
      protested the attempt would be something very like sacrilege; to prevent
      which, she gave a hint to Helen of what was in contemplation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen knew that with Cecilia, when once she had set her heart upon a
      generous feat of this kind, remonstrance would be in vain; she dreaded
      that she would, if prevented from the meditated division of the sapphires,
      purchase for her a new set: she had not the least idea what the expense
      was, but, at the moment, she thought anything would be better than letting
      Cecilia spoil her mother&rsquo;s present, or put her under fresh obligations of
      this sort. She knew that the sapphires had been got from the jewellers
      with whom her uncle had dealt, and who were no strangers to her name; she
      wrote, and bespoke a similar set to Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Charmante!</i> the very thing,&rdquo; Mademoiselle Felicie foresaw, &ldquo;a young
      lady so well born would determine on doing. And if she might add a little
      word, it would be good at the same opportunity to order a ruby brooch, the
      same as her lady&rsquo;s, as that would be the next object in question for the
      second day&rsquo;s regatta ball, when it would be indispensable for that night&rsquo;s
      appearance; <i>positivement</i>, she knew her lady would do it for Miss
      Stanley if Miss Stanley did not do it of her own head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen did not think that a brooch could be very expensive; there was not
      time to consider about it&mdash;the post was going&mdash;she was afraid
      that Lady Cecilia would come in and find her writing, and prevent her
      sending the letter. She hastily added an order for the brooch, finished
      the letter, and despatched it. And when it was gone she told Cecilia what
      she had done. Cecilia looked startled; she was well aware that Helen did
      not know the high price of what she had bespoken. But, determining that
      she would settle it her own way, she took care not to give any alarm, and
      shaking her head, she only reproached Helen playfully with having thus
      stolen a march upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think you have out-generaled me, but we shall see. Remember, I am the
      wife of a general, and not without resources.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Of the regatta, of the fineness of the weather, the beauty of the
      spectacle, and the dresses of the ladies, a full account appeared in the
      papers of the day, of which it would be useless here to give a repetition,
      and shameful to steal or seem to steal a description. We shall record only
      what concerns Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the freshness of youth and of her naturally happy temper, she was
      delighted with the whole, to her a perfectly new spectacle, and every body
      was pleased except Lady Katrine, who, in the midst of every amusement,
      always found something that annoyed her, something that &ldquo;should not have
      been so.&rdquo; She was upon this occasion more cross than usual, because this
      morning&rsquo;s uniform was not becoming to her, and was most particularly so to
      Miss Stanley, as all the gentlemen observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just in time before the ladies went to dress for the ball at night, the
      precious box arrived, containing the set of sapphires. Cecilia opened it
      eagerly, to see that all was right. Helen was not in the room. Lady
      Katrine stood by, and when she found that these were for Helen, her
      envious indignation broke forth. &ldquo;The poor daughters of peers cannot
      indulge in such things,&rdquo; cried she; &ldquo;they are fit only for rich heiresses!
      I understood,&rdquo; continued she, &ldquo;that Miss Stanley had given away her
      fortune to pay her uncle&rsquo;s debts, but I presume she has thought better of
      that, as I always prophesied she would&mdash;&mdash;generosity is
      charming, but, after all, sapphires are so becoming!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen came into the room just as this speech was ended. Lady Katrine had
      one of the bracelets in her hand. She looked miserably cross, for she had
      been disappointed about some ornaments she had expected by the same
      conveyance that brought Miss Stanley&rsquo;s. She protested that she had nothing
      fit to wear to-night. Helen looked at Cecilia; and though Cecilia&rsquo;s look
      gave no encouragement, she begged that Lady Katrine would do her the
      honour to wear these sapphires this night, since she had not received what
      her ladyship had ordered. Lady Katrine suffered herself to be prevailed
      on, but accepted with as ill a grace as possible. The ball went on, and
      Helen at least was happier than if she had worn the bracelets. She had no
      pleasure in being the object of envy, and now, when she found that Cecilia
      could be and was satisfied, though their ornaments were not exactly alike,
      it came full upon her mind that she had done foolishly in bespeaking these
      sapphires: it was at that moment only a transient self-reproach for
      extravagance, but before she went to rest this night it became more
      serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Davenant had been expected all day, but she did not arrive till late
      in the midst of the ball, and she just looked in at the dancers for a few
      minutes before she retired to her own apartment. Helen would have followed
      her, but that was not allowed. After the dancing was over, however, as she
      was going to her room, she heard Lady Davenant&rsquo;s voice, calling to her as
      she passed by; and, opening the door softly, she found her still awake,
      and desiring to see her for a few minutes, if she was not too much tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, not in the least tired; quite the contrary,&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      After affectionately embracing her, Lady Davenant held her at arms&rsquo; 
      length, and looked at her as the light of the lamp shone full upon her
      face and figure. Pleased with her whole appearance, Lady Davenant smiled,
      and said, as she looked at her&mdash;&ldquo;You seem, Helen, to have shared the
      grateful old fairy&rsquo;s gift to Lady Georgiana B. of the never-fading rose in
      the cheek. But what particularly pleases me, Helen, is the perfect
      simplicity of your dress. In the few minutes that I was in the ball-room
      to-night, I was struck with that over-dressed duchess: her figure has been
      before my eyes ever since, hung round with jewellery, and with that <i>auréole</i>
      a foot and a-half high on her head: like the Russian bride&rsquo;s headgear,
      which Heber so well called &lsquo;the most costly deformity he ever beheld.&rsquo; 
      Really, this passion for baubles,&rdquo; continued Lady Davenant, &ldquo;is the
      universal passion of our sex. I will give you an instance to what
      extravagance it goes. I know a lady of high rank, who hires a certain pair
      of emerald earrings at fifteen hundred pounds per annum. She rents them in
      this way from some German countess in whose family they are an heir-loom,
      and cannot be sold.&rdquo; Helen expressed her astonishment. &ldquo;This is only one
      instance, my dear; I could give you hundreds. Over the whole world, women
      of all ages, all ranks, all conditions, have been seized with this bauble
      insanity&mdash;from the counter to the throne. Think of Marie Antoinette
      and the story of her necklace; and Josephine and her Cisalpine pearls, and
      all the falsehoods she told about them to the emperor she reverenced, the
      husband she loved&mdash;and all for what?&mdash;a string of beads! But I
      forget,&rdquo; cried Lady Davenant, interrupting herself, &ldquo;I must not forget how
      late it is: and I am keeping you up, and you have been dancing: forgive
      me! When once my mind is moved, I forget all hours. Good night&mdash;or
      good morning, my dear child; go, and rest.&rdquo; But just as Helen was
      withdrawing her hand, Lady Davenant&rsquo;s eye fixed on her pearl bracelets&mdash;&ldquo;Roman
      pearls, or real? Real, I see, and very valuable!&mdash;given to you, I
      suppose, by your poor dear extravagant uncle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen cleared her uncle&rsquo;s memory from this imputation, and explained that
      the bracelets were a present from General Clarendon. She did not know they
      were so &ldquo;very valuable,&rdquo; but she hoped she had not done wrong to accept of
      them in the circumstances; and she told how she had been induced to take
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Davenant said she had done quite right. The general was no
      present-maker, and this exception in his favour could not lead to any
      future inconvenience. &ldquo;But Cecilia,&rdquo; continued she, &ldquo;is too much addicted
      to trinket giving, which ends often disagreeably even between friends, or
      at all events fosters a foolish taste, and moreover associates it with
      feelings of affection in a way particularly deceitful and dangerous to
      such a little, tender-hearted person as I am speaking to, whose common
      sense would too easily give way to the pleasure of pleasing or fear of
      offending a friend. Kiss me, and don&rsquo;t contradict me, for your conscience
      tells you that what I say is true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sapphires, the ruby brooch, and all her unsettled accounts, came
      across Helen&rsquo;s mind; and if the light had shone upon her face at that
      moment, her embarrassment must have been seen; but Lady Davenant, as she
      finished the last words, laid her head upon the pillow, and she turned and
      settled herself comfortably to go to sleep. Helen retired with a
      disordered conscience; and the first thing she did in the morning was to
      look in the red case in which the sapphires came, to see if there was any
      note of their price; she recollected having seen some little bit of card&mdash;it
      was found on the dressing-table. When she beheld the price, fear took away
      her breath&mdash;it was nearly half her whole year&rsquo;s income; still she <i>could</i>
      pay it. But the ruby brooch that had not yet arrived&mdash;what would that
      cost? She hurried to her accounts; she had let them run on for months
      unlooked at, but she thought she must know the principal articles of
      expense in dress by her actual possessions. There was a heap of little
      crumpled bills which, with Felicie&rsquo;s griffonage, Helen had thrown into her
      table-drawer. In vain did she attempt to decipher the figures, like
      apothecaries&rsquo; marks, linked to quarters and three-quarters, and yards, of
      gauzes, silks, and muslins, altogether inextricably puzzling. They might
      have been at any other moment laughable, but now they were quite terrible
      to Helen; the only thing she could make clearly out was the total; she was
      astonished when she saw to how much little nothings can amount, an
      astonishment felt often by the most experienced&mdash;how much more by
      Helen, all unused to the arithmetic of economy! At this instant her maid
      came in smiling with a packet, as if sure of being the bearer of the very
      thing her young lady most wished for; it was the brooch&mdash;the very
      last thing in the world she desired to see. With a trembling hand she
      opened the parcel, looked at the note of the price, and sank upon her
      chair half stupified, with her eyes fixed upon the sum. She sat she knew
      not how long, till, roused by the opening of Cecilia&rsquo;s door, she hastened
      to put away the papers. &ldquo;Let me see them, my dear, don&rsquo;t put away those
      papers,&rdquo; cried Cecilia; &ldquo;Felicie tells me that you have been at these
      horrid accounts these two hours, and&mdash;you look&mdash;my dear Helen,
      you must let me see how much it is!&rdquo; She drew the total from beneath
      Helen&rsquo;s hand. It was astounding even to Cecilia, as appeared by her first
      unguarded look of surprise. But, recovering herself immediately, she in a
      playfully scolding tone told Helen that all this evil came upon her in
      consequence of her secret machinations. &ldquo;You set about to counteract me,
      wrote for things that I might not get them for you, you see what has come
      of it! As to these bills, they are all from tradespeople who cannot be in
      a hurry to be paid; and as to the things Felicie has got for you, she can
      wait, is not she a waiting-woman by profession? Now, where is the
      ruby-brooch? Have you never looked at it?&mdash;I hope it is pretty&mdash;I
      am sure it is handsome,&rdquo; cried she as she opened the case. &ldquo;Yes; I like it
      prodigiously, I will take it off your hands, my dear; will that do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Cecilia, I cannot let you do that, for you have one the same, I know,
      and you cannot want another&mdash;no, no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak like an angel, my dear, but you do not look like one,&rdquo; said
      Cecilia. &ldquo;So woe-begone, so pale a creature, never did I see! do look at
      yourself in the glass; but you are too wretched to plague. Seriously, I
      want this brooch, and mine it must be&mdash;it is mine: I have a use for
      it, I assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you have a use for it, really,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;I should indeed be
      very glad&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be glad then, it is mine,&rdquo; said Cecilia; &ldquo;and now it is yours, my dear
      Helen, now, not a word! pray, if you love me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen could not accept of it; she thanked Cecilia with all her heart, she
      felt her kindness&mdash;her generosity, but even the hitherto irresistible
      words, &ldquo;If you love me,&rdquo; were urged in vain. If she had not been in actual
      need of money, she might have been over-persuaded, but now her spirit of
      independence strengthened her resolution, and she persisted in her
      refusal. Lady Davenant&rsquo;s bell rang, and Helen, slowly rising, took up the
      miserable accounts, and said, &ldquo;Now I must go&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where!&rdquo; said Cecilia; &ldquo;you look as if you had heard a knell that summoned
      you&mdash;what are you going to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell all my follies to Lady Davenant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell your follies to nobody but me,&rdquo; cried Lady Cecilia. &ldquo;I have enough
      of my own to sympathise with you, but do not go and tell them to my
      mother, of all people; she, who has none of her own, how can you expect
      any mercy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not; I am content to bear all the blame I so richly deserve, but I
      know that after she has heard me, she will tell me what I ought to do, she
      will find out some way of settling it all rightly, and if that can but be,
      I do not care how much I suffer. So the sooner I go to her the better,&rdquo;
       said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you need not be in such a hurry; do not be like the man who said, &lsquo;Je
      veux être l&rsquo;enfant prodigue, je veux être l&rsquo;enfant perdu.&rsquo; L&rsquo;enfant
      prodigue, well and good, but why l&rsquo;enfant perdu?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Cecilia, do not play with me now&mdash;do not stop me,&rdquo; said
      Helen anxiously. &ldquo;It is serious with me now, and it is as much as I can do&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia let her go, but trembled for her, as she looked after her, and saw
      her stop at her mother&rsquo;s door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen&rsquo;s first knock was too low, it was unheard, she was obliged to wait;
      another, louder, was answered by, &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo; And in the presence she
      stood, and into the middle of things she rushed at once; the accounts, the
      total, lay before Lady Davenant. There it was: and the culprit, having
      made her confession, stood waiting for the sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first astonished change of look, was certainly difficult to sustain.
      &ldquo;I ought to have foreseen this,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant; &ldquo;my affection has
      deceived my judgment. Helen, I am sorry for your sake, and for my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh do not speak in that dreadful calm voice, as if&mdash;do not give me
      up at once,&rdquo; cried Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can I do for you? what can be done for one who has no strength of
      mind?&rdquo; I have some, thought Helen, or I should not be here at this moment.
      &ldquo;Of what avail, Helen, is your good heart&mdash;your good intentions,
      without the power to abide by them? When you can be drawn aside from the
      right by the first paltry temptation&mdash;by that most contemptible of
      passions&mdash;the passion for baubles! You tell me it was not that, what
      then? a few words of persuasion from any one who can smile, and fondle,
      and tell you that they love you;&mdash;the fear of offending Cecilia! how
      absurd! Is this what you both call friendship? But weaker still, Helen, I
      perceive that you have been led blindfold in extravagance by a prating
      French waiting-maid&mdash;to the brink of ruin, the very verge of
      dishonesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dishonesty! how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask yourself, Helen: is a person honest, who orders and takes from the
      owner that for which he cannot pay? Answer me, honest or dishonest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dishonest! if I had intended not to pay. But I did intend to pay, and I
      will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will! The weak have no will&mdash;never dare to say I will. Tell me
      how you will pay that which you owe. You have no means&mdash;no choice,
      except to take from the fund you have already willed to another purpose.
      See what good intentions, come to, Helen, when you cannot abide by them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can,&rdquo; cried Helen; &ldquo;whatever else I do, I will not touch that fund,
      destined for my dear uncle&mdash;I have not touched it. I could pay it in
      two years, and I will&mdash;I will give up my whole allowance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what will you live upon in the mean time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not have said my whole allowance, but I can do with very little,
      I will buy nothing new.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buy nothing&mdash;live upon nothing!&rdquo; repeated Lady Davenant; &ldquo;how often
      have I heard these words said by the most improvident, in the moment of
      repentance, even then as blind and uncalculating as ever! And you, Helen,
      talk to me of your powers of forbearance,&mdash;you, who, with the
      strongest motive your heart could feel, have not been able for a few short
      months to resist the most foolish&mdash;the most useless fancies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen burst into tears. But Lady Davenant, unmoved, at least to all
      outward appearance, coldly said, &ldquo;It is not feeling that you want, or that
      I require from you; I am not to be satisfied by words or tears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I deserve it all,&rdquo; said Helen; &ldquo;and I know you are not cruel. In the
      midst of all this, I know you are my best friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Davenant was now obliged to be silent, lest her voice should betray
      more tenderness than her countenance chose to show.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only tell me what I can do now,&rdquo; continued Helen; &ldquo;what can I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you CAN do, I will tell you, Helen. Who was the man you were dancing
      with last night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I danced with several; which do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your partner in the quadrille you were dancing when I came in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Estridge: but you know him&mdash;he has been often here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he rich?&rdquo; said Lady Davenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, very rich, and very self-sufficient: he is the man Cecilia used
      to call &lsquo;<i>Le prince de mon mérite.</i>&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she? I do not remember. He made no impression on me, nor on you, I
      dare say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the least, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter, he will do as well as another, since he is rich. You can marry
      him, and pay your present debts, and contract new, for thousands instead
      of hundreds:&mdash;this is what you CAN do, Helen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I can?&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can, I suppose, as well as others. You know that young ladies often
      marry to pay their debts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I once heard,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;but is it possible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite. You might have been told more&mdash;that they enter into regular
      partnerships, joint-stock companies with dress-makers and jewellers, who
      make their ventures and bargains on the more or less reputation of the
      young ladies for beauty or for fashion, supply them with finery, speculate
      on their probabilities of matrimonial success, and trust to being repaid
      after marriage. Why not pursue this plan next season in town? You must
      come to it like others, whose example you follow&mdash;why not begin it
      immediately?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There is nothing so reassuring to the conscience as to hear, in the midst
      of blame that we do deserve, suppositions of faults, imputations which we
      know to be unmerited&mdash;impossible. Instead of being hurt or alarmed by
      what Lady Davenant had said, the whole idea appeared to Helen so utterly
      beneath her notice, that the words made scarcely any impression on her
      mind, and her thoughts went earnestly back to the pressing main question&mdash;&ldquo;What
      can I do, honestly to pay this money that I owe?&rdquo; She abruptly asked Lady
      Davenant if she thought the jeweller could be prevailed upon to take back
      the sapphires and the brooch?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not, without a considerable loss to you,&rdquo; replied Lady
      Davenant; but with an obvious change for the better in her countenance,
      she added, &ldquo;Still the determination to give up the bauble is good; the
      means, at whatever loss, we will contrive for you, if you are determined.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Determined!&mdash;oh yes.&rdquo; She ran for the bracelets and brooch, and
      eagerly put them into Lady Davenant&rsquo;s hand. And now another bright idea
      came into her mind: she had a carriage of her own&mdash;a very handsome
      carriage, almost new; she could part with it&mdash;yes, she would, though
      it was a present from her dear uncle&mdash;his last gift; and he had taken
      such pleasure in having it made perfect for her. She was very, very fond
      of it, but she would part with it; she saw no other means of abiding by
      her promise, and paying his debts and her own. This passed rapidly through
      her mind; and when she had expressed her determination, Lady Davenant&rsquo;s
      manner instantly returned to all its usual kindness, and she exclaimed as
      she embraced her, drew her to her, and kissed her again and again&mdash;&ldquo;You
      are my own Helen! These are deeds, Helen, not words: I am satisfied&mdash;I
      may be satisfied with you now!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And about that carriage, my dear, it shall not go to a stranger, it shall
      be mine. I want a travelling chaise&mdash;I will purchase it from you: I
      shall value it for my poor friend&rsquo;s sake, and for yours, Helen. So now it
      is settled, and you are clear in the world again. I will never spoil you,
      but I will always serve you, and a greater pleasure I cannot have in this
      world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this happy termination of the dreaded confession, how much did Helen
      rejoice that she had had the courage to tell all to her friend. The pain
      was transient&mdash;the confidence permanent.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Helen was going into her own room, she saw Cecilia flying up stairs
      towards her, with an open letter in her hand, her face radiant with joy.
      &ldquo;I always knew it would all end well! Churchill might well say that all
      the sand in my hour-glass was diamond sand. There, my dear Helen&mdash;there,&rdquo;
       cried Cecilia, embracing her as she put the letter into her hand. It was
      from Beauclerc, his answer to Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s letter, which had followed
      him to Naples. It was written the very instant he had read her
      explanation, and, warm from his heart, he poured out all the joy he felt
      on hearing the truth, and, in his transport of delight, he declared that
      he quite forgave Lady Cecilia, and would forget, as she desired, all the
      misery she had made him feel. Some confounded quarantine he feared might
      detain him, but he would certainly be at Clarendon Park in as short a time
      as possible. Helen&rsquo;s first smile, he said, would console him for all he
      had suffered, and make him forget everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen&rsquo;s first smile he did not see, nor the blush which spread and rose as
      she read. Cecilia was delighted. &ldquo;Generous, affectionate Cecilia!&rdquo; thought
      Helen; &ldquo;if she has faults, and she really has but one, who could help
      loving her?&rdquo; Not Helen, certainly, or she would have been the most
      ungrateful of human beings. Besides her sympathy in Helen&rsquo;s happiness,
      Cecilia was especially rejoiced at this letter, coming, as it did, the
      very day after her mother&rsquo;s return; for though she had written to Lady
      Davenant on Beauclerc&rsquo;s departure, and told her that he was gone only on
      Lord Beltravers&rsquo; account, yet she dreaded that, when it came to speaking,
      her mother&rsquo;s penetration would discover that something extraordinary had
      happened. Now all was easy. Beauclerc was coming back: he had finished his
      friend&rsquo;s business, and, before he returned to Clarendon Park he wished to
      know if he might appear there as the acknowledged admirer of Miss Stanley&mdash;if
      he might with any chance of success pay his addresses to her. Secure that
      her mother would never ask to see the letter, considering it either as a
      private communication to his guardian, or as a love letter to Helen,
      Cecilia gave this version of it to Lady Davenant; and how she settled it
      with the general, Helen never knew, but it seemed all smooth and right.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, the regatta being at an end, the archery meetings over, and no
      hope of further gaiety for this season at Clarendon Park, the Castleforts
      and Lady Katrine departed. Lady Katrine&rsquo;s last satisfaction was the hard
      haughty look with which she took leave of Miss Stanley&mdash;a look
      expressing, as well as the bitter smile and cold form of good breeding
      could express it, unconquered, unconquerable hate.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      There is no better test of the strength of affection than the ready
      turning of the mind to the little concerns of a friend, when preoccupied
      with important interests of our own. This was a proof of friendship, which
      Lady Davenant had lately given to Helen, for, at the time when she had
      entered with so much readiness and zeal into Helen&rsquo;s little difficulties
      and debts, great political affairs and important interests of Lord
      Davenant&rsquo;s were in suspense, and pressed heavily upon her mind. What might
      be the nature of these political embarrassments had not been explained.
      Lady Davenant had only hinted at them. She said, &ldquo;she knew from the terror
      exhibited by the inferior creatures in office that some change in
      administration was expected, as beasts are said to howl and tremble before
      storm, or earthquake, or any great convulsion of nature takes place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Since Lady Davenant&rsquo;s return from town, where Lord Davenant still
      remained, nothing had been said of the embassy to Russia but that it was
      delayed. Lady Cecilia, who was quick, and, where she was not herself
      concerned, usually right, in interpreting the signs of her mother&rsquo;s
      discomfiture, guessed that Lord Davenant had been circumvented by some
      diplomatist of inferior talents, and she said to Helen, &ldquo;When an ass kicks
      you never tell it, is a maxim which mamma heard from some friend, and she
      always acts upon it; but a kick, whether given by ass or not, leaves a
      bruise, which sometimes tells in spite of ourselves, and my mother should
      remember another maxim of that friend&rsquo;s, that the faults and follies of
      the great are the delight and comfort of the little. Now, my mother,
      though she is so well suited, from her superior abilities and strength of
      mind, and all that, to be the wife of a great political leader, yet in
      some respects she is the most unfit person upon earth for <i>the situation</i>;
      for, though she feels the necessity of conciliating, she cannot unbend
      with her inferiors, that is, with half the world. As Catalani said of
      singing, it is much more difficult to descend than to ascend well.
      Shockingly mamma shows in her manner sometimes how tired she is of the
      stupid, and how she despises the mean; and all the underlings think she
      can undo them with papa, for it has gone abroad that she <i>governs</i>,
      while in fact, though papa asks her advice, to be sure, because she is so
      wise, she never does interfere in the least; but, now it has once got into
      the world&rsquo;s obstinate head that she does, it cannot be put out again, and
      mamma is the last person upon earth to take her own part, or condescend to
      explain and set things right. She is always thinking of papa&rsquo;s glory and
      the good of the public, but the public will never thank him and much less
      her; so there she is a martyr, without her crown; now, if I were to make a
      martyr of myself, which, Heaven forbid! I would at least take right good
      care to secure my crown, and to have my full glory round my head, and set
      on becomingly. But seriously, my dear Helen,&rdquo; continued Lady Cecilia, &ldquo;I
      am unhappy about papa and mamma, I assure you. I have seen little clouds
      of discontent long gathering, lowering, and blackening, and I know they
      will burst over their heads in some tremendous storm at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen hoped not, but looked frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you may hope not, my dear, but I know it will be&mdash;we may not
      hear the thunder, but we shall see the lightning all the more dangerous.
      We shall be struck down, unless&mdash;&rdquo; she paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless what?&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless the storm be dispersed in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lightning drawn off by some good conductor&mdash;such as myself; I am
      quite serious, and though you were angry with me for laughing just now, as
      if I was not the best of daughters, even though I laugh, I can tell you I
      am meditating an act of self-devotion for my mother&rsquo;s sake&mdash;a grand
      <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Coup d&rsquo;état</i>? you, Cecilia! my dear&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, Helen, little as you think of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of your political talents you don&rsquo;t expect me to think much, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My political talents! you shall see what they are. I am capable of a
      grand <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i>. I will have next week a three days&rsquo; congress,
      anti-political, at Clarendon Park, where not a word of politics shall be
      heard, nor any thing but nonsense if I can help it, and the result shall
      be, as you shall see, goodwill between all men and all women&mdash;women?
      yes, there&rsquo;s the grand point. Mamma has so affronted two ladies, very
      influential as they call it, each&mdash;Lady Masham, a favourite at court,
      and Lady Bearcroft, risen from the ranks, on her husband&rsquo;s shoulders; he,
      &lsquo;a man of law,&rsquo; Sir Benjamin Bearcroft, and very clever she is I hear, but
      loud and coarse; absolutely inadmissible she was thought till lately, and
      now, only tolerated for her husband&rsquo;s sake, but still have her here I
      must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you had better not,&rdquo; remonstrated Helen; &ldquo;if she is so very
      vulgar, Lady Davenant and the general will never endure her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he will! the general will bear a great deal for mamma&rsquo;s sake, and
      more for papa&rsquo;s. I must have her, my dear, for the husband is of
      consequence and, though he is ashamed of her, for that very reason he
      cannot bear that any body should neglect her, and terribly mamma has
      neglected her! Now, my dear Helen, do not say a word more against it.&rdquo;
       Very few words had Helen said. &ldquo;I must ponder well,&rdquo; continued Cecilia,
      &ldquo;and make out my list of worthies, my concordatum party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen much advised the consulting Lady Davenant first; but Lady Cecilia
      feared her mother might be too proud to consent to any advance on her own
      part. Helen still feared that the bringing together such discordant people
      would never succeed, but Lady Cecilia, always happy in paying herself with
      words answerable to her wishes, replied, &ldquo;that discords well managed often
      produced the finest harmony.&rdquo; The only point she feared was, that she
      should not gain the first step, that she should not be able to prevail
      upon the general to let her give the invitations. In truth, it required
      all her persuasive words, and more persuasive looks to accomplish this
      preliminary, and to bring General Clarendon to invite, or permit to be
      invited, to Clarendon Park, persons whom he knew but little, and liked not
      at all. But as Lady Cecilia pleaded and urged that it would soon be over,
      &ldquo;the whole will be over in three days&mdash;only a three days&rsquo; visit; and
      for mamma!&mdash;I am sure, Clarendon&mdash;you will do anything for her,
      and for papa, and your own Cecilia? &ldquo;&mdash;the general smiled, and the
      notes were written, and the invitations were accepted, and when once
      General Clarendon had consented, he was resolutely polite in his reception
      of these to him unwelcome guests. His manner was not false; it was only
      properly polite, not tending to deceive any one who understood the tokens
      of conventional good breeding. It however required considerable power over
      himself to keep the line of demarcation correctly, with one person in
      particular to whom he had a strong political aversion: Mr. Harley.&mdash;His
      very name was abhorrent to General Clarendon, who usually designated him
      as &ldquo;That Genius, Cecilia&mdash;that favourite of your mother&rsquo;s! &ldquo;&mdash;while
      to Lady Davenant Mr. Harley was the only person from whose presence she
      anticipated any pleasure, or who could make the rest of the party to her
      endurable. Helen, though apprehensive of what might be the ultimate result
      of this congress, yet could not help rejoicing that she should now have an
      opportunity of seeing some of those who are usually considered &ldquo;high as
      human veneration can look.&rdquo; It is easy, after one knows who is who, to
      determine that we should have found out the characteristic qualities and
      talents in each countenance. Lady Cecilia, however, would not tell Helen
      the names of the celebrated unknown who were assembled when they went into
      the drawing-room before dinner, and she endeavoured to guess from their
      conversation the different characters of the speakers; but only a few
      sentences were uttered, signifying nothing; snuff-boxes were presented,
      pinches taken and inclinations made with becoming reciprocity, but the
      physiognomy of a snuff-box Helen could not interpret, though Lavater
      asserts that every thing in nature, even a cup of tea, has a physiognomy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner was announced, and the company paired off, seemingly not standing
      on the order of their going; yet all, especially as some were strangers,
      secretly mindful of their honours, and they moved on in precedence just,
      and found themselves in places due at the dinner-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Helen did not seem likely to obtain more insight into the characters
      of these great personages in the dining-room than she had done in the
      drawing-room. For it often happens that, when the most celebrated, and
      even the most intellectual persons are brought together expressly for the
      purpose of conversation, then it does not flow, but sinks to silence, and
      ends at last in the stagnation of utter stupidity. Each seems oppressed
      with the weight of his own reputation, and, in the pride of high
      celebrity, and the shyness, real or affected, of high rank, each fears to
      commit himself by a single word. People of opposite parties, when thrown
      together, cannot at once change the whole habit of their minds, nor
      without some effort refrain from that abuse of their opposites in which
      they are accustomed to indulge when they have it all to themselves. Now
      every subject seems laboured&mdash;for in the pedantry of party spirit no
      partisan will speak but in the slang or cant of his own craft. Knowledge
      is not only at one entrance, but at every entrance quite shut out, and
      even literature itself grows perilous, so that to be safe they must all be
      dumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia Clarendon was little aware of what she undertook when she
      called together this heterogeneous assembly of uncongenials and
      dissimilars round her dinner-table. After she had in vain made what
      efforts she could, and, well skilled in throwing the ball of conversation,
      had thrown it again and again without rebound from either side, she felt
      that all was flat, and that the silence and the stupidity were absolutely
      invincible. Helen could scarcely believe, when she tried afterwards to
      recollect, that she had literally this day, during the whole of the first
      course, heard only the following sentences, which came out at long
      intervals between each couple of questions and answers&mdash;or
      observations and acquiescences:&mdash;&ldquo;We had a shower.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, I
      think so.&rdquo; &ldquo;But very fine weather we have had.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Only too hot.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Quite.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;The new buildings at Marblemore&mdash;are they getting on, my Lord?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Do
      not know; did not come that way.&rdquo; &ldquo;Whom have they now at Dunstanbury?&rdquo; was
      the next question. Then in reply came slowly a list of fashionable names.
      &ldquo;Sir John died worth a million, they say.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, a martyr to the
      gout.&rdquo; &ldquo;Has Lady Rachel done any thing for her eyes?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Gone to
      Brighton, I believe.&rdquo; &ldquo;Has any thing been heard of the North Pole
      expedition?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Not a word.&rdquo; &ldquo;Crockly has got a capital cook, and
      English too.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;English! eh?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;English&mdash;yes.&rdquo; Lord
      Davenant hoped this English cook would, with the assistance of several of
      his brother <i>artistes</i> of the present day, redeem our country from
      one-half of the Abbé Gregoire&rsquo;s reproach. The abbé has said that England
      would be the finest country in the world, but that it wants two
      essentials, <i>sunshine</i> and <i>cooks</i>. &ldquo;Good! Good! Very!&rdquo; voices
      from different sides of the table pronounced; and there was silence again.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the dessert, however, after the servants had withdrawn, most people
      began to talk a little to their next neighbours; but by this Helen
      profited not, for each pair spoke low, and those who were beside her on
      either hand, were not disposed to talk; she was seated between Sir
      Benjamin Bearcroft and Mr. Harley&mdash;Sir Benjamin the man of law, and
      Mr. Harley the man of genius, each eminent in his kind; but he of law
      seemed to have nothing in him but law, of which he was very full. In Sir
      Benjamin&rsquo;s economy of human life it was a wholesome rule, which he
      practised invariably, to let his understanding sleep in company, that it
      might waken in the courts, and for his repose he needed not what some
      great men have professed so much to like&mdash;&ldquo;the pillow of a woman&rsquo;s
      mind.&rdquo; Helen did not much regret the silence of this great legal
      authority, but she was very sorry that the man of genius did not talk; she
      did not expect him to speak to her, but she wished to hear him converse
      with others. But something was the matter with him; from the moment he sat
      down to dinner Helen saw he seemed discomfited. He first put his hand
      across his eyes, then pressed his forehead: she feared he had a bad
      headache. The hand went next to his ear, with a shrinking, excruciating
      gesture; it must be the earache thought Helen. Presently his jaws were
      pinched together; toothache perhaps. At last she detected the disturbing
      cause. Opposite to Mr. Harley, and beside Lady Davenant, sat a person whom
      he could not endure; one, in the first place, of an opposite party, but
      that was nothing; a man who was, in Mr. Harley&rsquo;s opinion, a disgrace to
      any party, and what could bring him here? They had had several battles in
      public, but had never before met in private society, and the aversion of
      Mr. Harley seemed to increase inversely as the squares of the distance.
      Helen could not see in the object adequate cause for this antipathy: the
      gentleman looked civil, smiling, rather mean, and quite insignificant, and
      he really was as insignificant as he appeared&mdash;not of consequence in
      any point of view. He was not high in office, nor ambassador, nor <i>chargé-d&rsquo;affaires</i>;
      not certain that he was an <i>attaché</i> even, but he was said to have
      the ear of <i>somebody</i>, and was reputed to be secretly employed in
      diplomatic transactions of equivocal character; disclaimed, but used, by
      his superiors, and courted by his timid inferiors, whom he had persuaded
      of his great influence <i>somewhere</i>. Lady Cecilia had been assured,
      from good authority, that he was one who ought to be propitiated on her
      father&rsquo;s account, but now, when she perceived what sort of creature he
      was, sorely did she repent that he had been invited; and her mother, by
      whom he sat, seemed quite oppressed and nauseated.
    </p>
    <p>
      So ended the dinner. And, as Lady Cecilia passed the general in going out
      of the room, she looked her contrition, her acknowledgment that he was
      perfectly right in his prophecy that it would never do.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was rather worse when the ladies were by themselves. Some of the party
      were personally strangers to Lady Davenant; all had heard of her
      sufficiently; most had formed a formidable and false opinion of her. Helen
      was quite astonished at the awe her ladyship inspired in strangers. Lady
      Davenant&rsquo;s appearance and manner at this moment were not, indeed,
      calculated to dispel this dread. She was unusually distant and haughty,
      from a mistaken sort of moral pride. Aware that some of the persons now
      before her had, in various ways, by their own or their husbands&rsquo; means,
      power to serve or to injure Lord Davenant, she disdained to propitiate
      them by the slightest condescension.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how any persons in England&mdash;in London&mdash;could be strangers to
      Lady Davenant, was to a foreign lady who was present, matter of
      inexpressible surprise. She could not understand how the wives of persons
      high in political life, some of opposite, but some of the same parties,
      should often be personally strangers to each other. Foreigners are, on
      first coming to England, apt to imagine that all who act together in
      public life must be of the same private society; while, on the contrary,
      it often happens that the ladies especially of the same party are in
      different grades of fashion&mdash;moving in different orbits. The number
      of different circles and orbits in London is, indeed, astonishing to
      strangers, and the manner in which, though touching at tangents, these
      keep each their own path, attracted and repelled, or mutually influential,
      is to those who have not seen and studied the planisphere, absolutely
      incomprehensible. And, as she pondered on this difficulty, the
      ambassadress, all foreigner as she was, and all unused to silence, spoke
      not, and no one spoke: and nought was heard but the cup on the saucer, or
      the spoon in the cup, or the buzzing of a fly in the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of this awful calm it was that Lady Bearcroft blurted out
      with loud voice&mdash;&ldquo;Amazing entertaining we are! so many clever people
      got together, too, for what?&rdquo; It was worth while to have seen Lady
      Masham&rsquo;s face at that moment! Lady Bearcroft saw it, and, fearing no
      mortal, struck with the comic of that look of Lady Masham&rsquo;s, burst into
      laughter uncontrolled, and the contrast of dignity and gravity in Lady
      Davenant only made her laugh the more, till out of the room at last she
      ran. Lady Masham all the while, of course, never betrayed the slightest
      idea that she could by any possibility have been the object of Lady
      Bearcroft&rsquo;s mirth. But Lady Davenant&mdash;how did she take it? To her
      daughter&rsquo;s infinite relief, quite quietly; she looked rather amused than
      displeased. She bore with Lady Bearcroft, altogether, better than could
      have been expected; because she considered her only as a person
      unfortunately out of her place in society, and, without any fault of her
      own, dragged up from below to a height of situation for which nature had
      never intended, and neither art nor education had ever prepared her; whose
      faults and deficiencies were thus brought into the flash of day at once,
      before the malice of party and the fastidiousness of fashion, which knows
      not to distinguish between <i>manque d&rsquo;esprit</i>, and <i>manque d&rsquo;usage</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not so Lady Davenant: she made liberal and philosophic allowance for even
      those faults of manner which were most glaring, and she further suspected
      that Lady Bearcroft purposely exaggerated her own vulgarity, partly for
      diversion, partly to make people stare, and partly to prevent their seeing
      what was habitual, and what involuntary, by hiding the bounds of reality.
      Of this Lady Masham had not the most distant conception; on the contrary,
      she was now prepared to tell a variety of odd anecdotes of Lady Bearcroft.
      She had seen, she said, this extraordinary person before, but had never
      met her in society, and delighted she was unexpectedly to find her here&mdash;&ldquo;quite
      a treat.&rdquo; Such characters are indeed seldom met with at a certain height
      in the atmosphere of society, and such were peculiarly and justly Lady
      Masham&rsquo;s delight, for they relieved and at the same time fed a sense of
      superiority insufficient to itself. Such a person is fair, privileged,
      safe game, and Lady Masham began, as does a reviewer determined to be
      especially severe, with a bit of praise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really very handsome, Lady Bearcroft must have been! Yes, as you say,
      Lady Cecilia, she is not out of blow yet certainly, only too full blown
      rather for some tastes&mdash;fortunately not for Sir Benjamin; he married
      her, you know, long ago, for her beauty; she is a very correct person&mdash;always
      was; but they do repeat the strangest things she says&mdash;so very odd!
      and they tell such curious stories, too, of the things she does.&rdquo; Lady
      Masham then detailed a variety of anecdotes, which related chiefly to Lady
      Bearcroft&rsquo;s household cares, which never could she with haste despatch;
      then came stories of her cheap magnificence and extraordinary toilette
      expedients. &ldquo;I own,&rdquo; continued Lady Masham, &ldquo;that I always thought the
      descriptions I heard must be exaggerated; but one is compelled to
      acknowledge that there is here in reality a terrible want of tact. Poor
      Sir Benjamin! I quite pity him, he must so see it! Though not of the first
      water himself, yet still he must feel, when he sees Lady Bearcroft with
      other people! He has feeling, though nobody would guess it from his look,
      and he shows it too, I am told; sadly annoyed he is sometimes by her <i>malapropoisms</i>.
      One day, she at one end of the table and he at the other, her ladyship, in
      her loud voice called out to him, &lsquo;Sir Benjamin! Sir Benjamin! this is our
      wedding-day!&rsquo; He, poor man, did not hear; she called out again louder,
      &lsquo;Sir Benjamin, my dear, this day fifteen years ago you and I were
      married!&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, my dear,&rsquo; he answered, &lsquo;well, my dear, how can I possibly
      help that now!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pleased with the success of this anecdote, which raised a general smile,
      Lady Masham vouched for its perfect correctness, &ldquo;she had it from one, who
      heard it from a person who was actually present at the time it happened.&rdquo;
       Lady Davenant had not the least doubt of the correctness of the story, but
      she believed the names of the parties were different; she had heard it
      years ago of another person. It often happens, as she observed, to those
      who make themselves notoriously ridiculous, as to those who become famous
      for wit, that all good things in their kinds are attributed to them;
      though the one may have no claim to half the witticisms, and the other may
      not be responsible for half the absurdities for which they have the
      reputation. It required all Lady Masham&rsquo;s politeness to look pleased, and
      all her candour to be quite happy to be set right as to that last
      anecdote. But many she had heard of Lady Bearcroft were really incredible.
      &ldquo;Yet one would almost believe anything of her.&rdquo; While she was yet
      speaking, Lady Bearcroft returned, and her malicious enemy, leaning back
      in her chair as if in expectation of the piece beginning, waited for her
      puppet to play or be played off.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time Lady Cecilia was not at ease; she, well aware what her
      mother would feel, and had felt, while Lady Masham was going on with this
      gossip-talk, had stood between her ladyship and Lady Davenant, and, as
      Lady Masham did not speak much above her breath, Cecilia had for some time
      flattered herself that her laudable endeavours to intercept the sound, or
      to prevent the sense from reaching her mother&rsquo;s ear, had succeeded,
      especially as she had made as many exclamations as she could of &ldquo;Really!&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; &ldquo;How extraordinary!&rdquo; &ldquo;You do not say so?&rdquo; which, as she
      pronounced them, might have excited the curiosity of commonplace people,
      but which she knew would in her mother&rsquo;s mind deaden all desire to listen.
      However, Lady Masham had raised her voice, and from time to time had
      stretched her neck of snow beyond Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s intercepting drapery, so
      as actually to claim Lady Davenant&rsquo;s attention. The consequences her
      daughter heard and felt. She heard the tap, tap, tap of the ivory
      folding-knife upon the table; and well interpreting, she knew, even before
      she saw her mother&rsquo;s countenance, that Lady Masham had undone herself,
      and, what was of much more consequence, had destroyed all chance of
      accomplishing that reconciliation with &ldquo;mamma,&rdquo; that projected coalition
      which was to have been of such ultimate advantage to &ldquo;papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding Lady Bearcroft&rsquo;s want of knowledge of the great world, she
      had considerable knowledge of human nature, which stood her wonderfully in
      stead. She had no notion of being made sport of for the <i>élégantes</i>,
      and, with all Lady Masham&rsquo;s plausibility of persiflage, she never obtained
      her end, and never elicited anything really absurd by all attempts to draw
      her out&mdash;out she would not be drawn. After an unconquerable silence
      and all the semblance of dead stupidity, Lady Bearcroft suddenly showed
      signs of life, however, and she, all at once, began to talk&mdash;to Helen
      of all people!&mdash;And why?&mdash;because she had taken, in her own
      phrase, a monstrous fancy to Miss Stanley; she was not sure of her name,
      but she knew she liked her nature, and it would be a pity that her reason
      should not be known and in the words in which she told it to Lady Cecilia,
      &ldquo;Now I will just tell you why I have taken such a monstrous fancy to your
      friend here, Miss Hanley&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Stanley&mdash;give me leave to mention,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia. &ldquo;Let me
      introduce you regularly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! by no means; don&rsquo;t trouble yourself now, Lady Cecilia, for I hate
      regular introductions. But, as I was going to tell you how, before dinner
      to-day, as I came down the great staircase, I had an uncommon large, big,
      and, for aught I know, yellow corking-pin, which that most careless of all
      careless maids of mine&mdash;a good girl, too&mdash;had left sticking
      point foremost out of some part of me. Miss Hanley&mdash;Stanley (beg
      pardon) was behind, and luckily saw and stopped. Out she pulled it,
      begging my pardon; so kindly too, I only felt the twitch on my sleeve, and
      turned, and loved the first sight I had of that pretty face, which need
      never blush, I am sure, though it&rsquo;s very becoming the blush too. So
      good-natured, you know, Lady Cecilia, it was, when nobody was looking, and
      before any body was the wiser. Not like some young ladies, or old even,
      that would have <i>showed one up</i>, rather than help one out in any
      pin&rsquo;s point of a difficulty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia herself was included in Lady Bearcroft&rsquo;s good graces, for she
      liked that winning way, and saw there was a real good-nature there, too.
      She opened to both friends cordially, <i>à propos</i> to some <i>love</i>
      of a lace trimming. Of lace she was a famous judge, and she went into
      details of her own good bargains, with histories of her expeditions into
      the extremity of the city in search of cheap goods and unheard of wonders
      at prime cost, in regions unknown. She told how it was her clever way to
      leave her carriage and her <i>people</i>, and go herself down narrow
      streets and alleys, where only wheel-barrows and herself could go; she
      boasted of her feats in diving into dark dens in search of run goods,
      charming things&mdash;French warranted&mdash;that could be had for next to
      nothing, and, in exemplification, showed the fineness of her embroidered
      cambric handkerchiefs, and told their price to farthing!
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Masham&rsquo;s &ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; was worthy of any Jesuit male or female, that
      ever existed.
    </p>
    <p>
      From her amazing bargains, the lady of the law-knight went on to
      smuggling; and, as she got into spirits, talking loudly, she told of some
      amber satin, a whole piece capitally got over in an old gentleman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Last
      Will and Testament,&rdquo; tied up with red tape so nicely, and sealed and
      superscribed and all, got through untouched! &ldquo;But a better thing I did
      myself,&rdquo; continued she; &ldquo;the last trip I made to Paris&mdash;coming back,
      I set at defiance all the searchers and <i>stabbers</i>, and custom-house
      officers of both nations. I had hundreds of pounds worth of Valenciennes
      and Brussels lace hid&mdash;you would never guess where. I never told a
      servant&mdash;not a mortal maid even; that&rsquo;s the only way; had only a
      confidante of a coachmaker. But when it came to packing-up time, my own
      maid smelt out the lace was missing; and gave notice, I am, confident, to
      the custom-house people to search me. So much the more glory to me. I got
      off clear; and, when they had stabbed the cushions, and torn the inside of
      my carriage all to pieces, I very coolly made them repair the mischief at
      their own cost. Oh, I love to do things bravely! and away I drove
      triumphant with the lace, well stuffed, packed, and covered within the
      pole leather of the carriage they had been searching all the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this period of her narrative the gentlemen came into the drawing-room.
      &ldquo;But here comes Sir Benjamin! mum, mum! not a word more for my life! You
      understand, Lady Cecilia! husbands must be minded. And let me whisper a
      favour&mdash;a whist-party I must beg; nothing keeps Sir Ben in
      good-humour so certainly as whist&mdash;when he wins, I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The whist-party was made, and Lady Cecilia took care that Sir Benjamin
      should win, while she lost with the best grace possible. By her
      conciliating manners and good management in dividing to govern, all
      parties were arranged to general satisfaction. Mr. Harley&rsquo;s antipathy, the
      <i>attaché</i>, she settled at ecartê with Lady Masham, who found him
      &ldquo;quite a well-mannered, pleasant person.&rdquo; Lady Cecilia explained to Mr.
      Harley, that it was her fault&mdash;her mistake entirely&mdash;that this
      person had been invited. Mr. Harley was now himself again, and happy in
      conversation with Lady Davenant, beside whom he found his place on the
      sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Helen had done her duty at harp and piano-forte, Cecilia relieved
      her, and whispered that she might now go to her mother&rsquo;s sofa, and rest
      and be happy. &ldquo;Mamma&rsquo;s work is in some puzzle, Helen; you must go and set
      it to rights, my dear.&rdquo; Lady Davenant welcomed her with a smile, made room
      for her on the sofa, and made over to her the tambour-frame; and now that
      Helen saw and heard Mr. Harley in his natural state, she could scarcely
      believe that he was the same person who had sat beside her at dinner.
      Animated and delightful he was now, and, what she particularly liked in
      him, there was no display&mdash;nothing in the Churchill style. Whenever
      any one came near, and seemed to wish to hear or speak, Mr. Harley not
      only gave them fair play, but helped them in their play. Helen observed
      that he possessed the art which she had often remarked in Lord Davenant,
      peculiar to good-natured genius&mdash;the art of drawing something good
      out of every body; sometimes more than they knew they had in them till it
      was brought out. Even from Lord Masham, insipid and soulless though he
      was, as any courtier-lord in waiting could be, something was extracted:
      Lord Masham, universally believed to have nothing in him, was this evening
      surprisingly entertaining. He gave Lady Davenant a description of what he
      had been so fortunate as to see&mdash;the first public dinner of the king
      of France on his restoration, served according to all the <i>ci-devant</i>
      ceremonials, and in the etiquette of Louis the Fourteenth&rsquo;s time. Lord
      Masham represented in a lively manner the Marquis de Dreux, in all his
      antiquarian glory, going through the whole form prescribed: first,
      knocking with his cane at the door; then followed by three guards with
      shouldered carbines, marching to buttery and hall, each and every officer
      of the household making reverential obeisance as they passed to the <i>Nef</i>&mdash;the
      <i>Nef</i> being, as Lord Masham explained to Miss Stanley, a piece of
      gilt plate in the shape of the hull of a ship, in which the napkins for
      the king&rsquo;s table are kept. &ldquo;But why the hull of a ship should be
      appropriated to the royal napkins?&rdquo; was asked. Lord Masham confessed that
      this was beyond him, but he looked amazingly considerate&mdash;delicately
      rubbed his polished forehead with the second finger of the right hand,
      then regarded his ring, and turned it thrice slowly round, but the
      talismanic action produced nothing, and he received timely relief by a new
      turn given to the conversation, in which he was not, he thought, called
      upon to take any share&mdash;the question indeed appeared to him
      irrelevant, and retiring to the card-table, he &ldquo;left the discussion to
      abler heads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The question was, why bow to the Nef at all?&mdash;This led to a
      discussion upon the advantages of ceremonials in preserving respect for
      order and reverence for authority, and then came an inquiry into the
      abuses of this real good. It was observed that the signs of the times
      should always be consulted, and should guide us in these things.&mdash;How
      far? was next to be considered. All agreed on the principle that &lsquo;order is
      Heaven&rsquo;s first law,&rsquo; yet there were in the application strong shades of
      difference between those who took part in the conversation. On one side,
      it was thought that overturning the <i>tabouret</i> at the court of France
      had been the signal for the overthrow of the throne; while, on the other
      hand, it was suggested that a rigid adherence to forms unsuited to the
      temper of the times only exasperates, and that, wherever reliance on forms
      is implicit, it is apt to lead princes and their counsellors to depend too
      much on the strength of that fence which, existing only in the
      imagination, is powerless when the fashion changes. In a court quite
      surrounded and enveloped by old forms, the light of day cannot penetrate
      to the interior of the palace, the eyes long kept in obscurity are
      weakened, so that light cannot be borne: when suddenly it breaks in, the
      royal captive is bewildered, and if obliged to act, he gropes, blunders,
      injures himself, and becomes incapable of decision in extremity of danger,
      reduced to the helplessness which marks the condition of the Eastern
      despot, or <i>les rois fainéans</i> of any time or country.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Helen sat by, listening to this conversation, what struck and
      interested her most was, the manner in which it went on and went off
      without leading to any unpleasant consequences, notwithstanding the
      various shades of opinion between the parties. This she saw depended much
      on the good sense and talents, but far more on the good breeding and
      temper of those who spoke and those who listened. Time in the first place
      was allowed and taken for each to be understood, and no one was urged by
      exclamation, or misconception, or contradiction, to say more than just the
      thing he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia, who had now joined the party, was a little in pain when she
      heard Louis the Fourteenth&rsquo;s love for punctuality alluded to. She dreaded,
      when the general quoted &ldquo;Punctuality is the virtue of princes,&rdquo; that Mr.
      Harley, with the usual impatience of genius, would have ridiculed so
      antiquated a notion; but, to Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s surprise, he even took the
      part of punctuality: in a very edifying manner he distinguished it from
      mere ceremonial etiquette&mdash;the ceremonial of the German courts, where
      &ldquo;they lose time at breakfast, at dinner, at supper; at court, in the
      antechamber, on the stairs, everywhere:&rdquo;&mdash;punctuality was, he
      thought, a habit worthy to be ranked with the virtues, by its effects upon
      the mind, the power it demands and gives of self-control, raising in us a
      daily, hourly sense of duty, of something that ought, that must be done,
      one of the best habits human creatures can have, either for their own sake
      or the sake of those with whom they live. And to kings and courtiers more
      particularly, because it gives the idea of stability&mdash;of duration;
      and to the aged, because it gives a sort of belief that life will last for
      ever. The general had often thought this, but said he had never heard it
      so well expressed; he afterwards acknowledged to Cecilia that he found Mr.
      Harley was quite a different person from what he had expected&mdash;&ldquo;He
      has good sense, as well as genius and good breeding. I am glad, my dear
      Cecilia, that you asked him here.&rdquo; This was a great triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards the close of the evening, when mortals are beginning to think of
      bed-chamber candles, Lady Cecilia looked at the <i>ecarté</i> table, and
      said to her mother, &ldquo;How happy they are, and how comfortable we are! A
      card-table is really a necessary of life&mdash;not even music is more
      universally useful.&rdquo; Mr. Harley said, &ldquo;I doubt,&rdquo; and then arose between
      Lady Davenant and him an argument upon the comparative power in modern
      society of music and cards. Mr. Harley took the side of music, but Lady
      Davenant inclined to think that cards, in their day, and their day is not
      over yet, have had a wider range of influence. &ldquo;Nothing like that happy
      board of green cloth; it brings all intellects to one level,&rdquo; she said.
      Mr. Harley pleaded the cause of music, which, he said, hushes all
      passions, calms even despair. Lady Davenant urged the silent superiority
      of cards, which rests the weary talker, and relieves the perplexed
      courtier, and, in support of her opinion, she mentioned an old ingenious
      essay on cards and tea, by Pinto, she thought; and she begged that Helen
      would some time look for it in the library. Helen went that instant. She
      searched, but could not find; where it ought to have been, there it of
      course was not. While she was still on the book-ladder, the door opened,
      and enter Lady Bearcroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Hanley!&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;I have a word to say to you, for, though you
      are a stranger to me, I see you are a dear good creature, and I think I
      may take the liberty of asking your advice in a little matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen, who had by this time descended from the steps, stood and looked a
      little surprised, but said all that was properly civil, &ldquo;gratified by Lady
      Bearcroft&rsquo;s good opinion&mdash;happy to be of any service,&rdquo;&mdash;&amp;c.
      &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then&mdash;sit ye down one instant, Miss Hanley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen suggested that her name was Stanley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stanley!&mdash;eh?&mdash;Yes, I remember. But I want to consult you,
      since you are so kind to allow me, on a little matter&mdash;but do sit
      down, I never can talk of business standing. Now I just want you, my dear
      Miss Hanley, to do a little job for me with Lady Davenant, who, with half
      an eye can see, is a great friend of yours.&mdash;Aren&rsquo;t I right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen said Lady Davenant was indeed a very kind friend of hers, but still
      what it could be in which Lady Bearcroft expected her assistance she could
      not imagine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not be frightened at the word job; if that is what alarms you,&rdquo;
       continued Lady Bearcroft, &ldquo;put your heart at ease, there is nothing of
      that sort here. It is only a compliment that I want to make, and nothing
      in the world expected in return for it&mdash;as it is a return in itself.
      But in the first place look at this cover.&rdquo; She produced the envelope of a
      letter. &ldquo;Is this Lady Davenant&rsquo;s handwriting, think you?&rdquo; She pointed to
      the word &ldquo;<i>Mis-sent</i>,&rdquo; written on the corner of the cover. Helen said
      it was Lady Davenant&rsquo;s writing. &ldquo;You are certain?&mdash;Well, that is odd!&mdash;Mis-sent!
      when it was directed to herself, and nobody else on earth, as you see as
      plain as possible&mdash;Countess Davenant, surely that is right enough?&rdquo;
       Then opening a red morocco case she showed a magnificent diamond Sevigné.
      &ldquo;Observe now,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;these diamonds are so big, my dear Miss
      Hanley&mdash;Stanley, they would have been quite out of my reach, only for
      that late French invention, which maybe you may not have heard of, nor
      should I, but for the hint of a friend at Paris, who is in the jewellery
      line. The French, you must know, have got the art of sticking small
      diamonds together so as to make little worthless ones into large, so that,
      as you see, you would never tell the difference; and as it was a new
      discovery, and something ingenious and scientific, and Lady Davenant being
      reported to be a scientific lady, as well as political and influential,
      and all that, I thought it a good opportunity, and a fine excuse for
      paying her a compliment, which I had long wished to pay, for she was once
      on a time very kind to Sir Ben, and got him appointed to his present
      station; and though Lord Davenant was the ostensible person, I considered
      her as the prime mover behind the curtain. Accordingly, I sat me down, and
      wrote as pretty a note as I could pen, and Sir Ben approved of the whole
      thing; but I don&rsquo;t say that I&rsquo;m positive he was as off-handed and
      clean-hearted in the matter as I was, for between you and I his gratitude,
      as they say of some people&rsquo;s, is apt to squint with one eye to the future
      as well as one to the past&mdash;you comprehend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen was not clear that she comprehended all that had been said; still
      less had she any idea what she could have to do in this matter; she waited
      for further explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now all I want from you then, Miss Hanley&mdash;Stanley I would say, I
      beg pardon, I&rsquo;m the worst at proper names that lives&mdash;but all I want
      of you, Miss Hanley, is&mdash;first, your opinion as to the validity of
      the handwriting,&mdash;well, you are positive, then, that this <i>mis-sent</i>
      is her hand. Now then, I want to know, do you think Lady Davenant knew
      what she was about when she wrote it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen&rsquo;s eyes opened to their utmost power of distension, at the idea of
      anybody&rsquo;s questioning that Lady Davenant knew what she was about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;La! my dear,&rdquo; said Lady Bearcroft; &ldquo;spare the whites of your eyes, I
      didn&rsquo;t mean she didn&rsquo;t know what she was about in <i>that</i> sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sense?&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in any particular sense,&rdquo; replied Lady Bearcroft. &ldquo;But let me go on,
      or we shall never come to an understanding; I only meant that her ladyship
      might have just sat down to answer my note, as I often do myself, without
      having read the whole through, or before I have taken it in quite.&rdquo; Helen
      thought this very unlikely to have happened with Lady Davenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But still it might have happened,&rdquo; continued Lady Bearcroft, &ldquo;that her
      ladyship did not notice the delicacy of the way in which the thing was <i>put</i>&mdash;for
      it really was put so that nobody could take hold of it against any of us&mdash;you
      understand; and after all, such a curiosity of a Sevigné as this, and such
      fine &lsquo;di&rsquo;monds,&rsquo; was too pretty, and too good a thing to be refused
      hand-over-head, in that way. Besides, my note was so respectable, and
      respectful, it surely required and demanded something more of an answer,
      methinks, from a person of birth or education, than the single bald word
      &lsquo;mis-sent,&rsquo; like the postman! Surely, Miss Hanley, now, putting your
      friendship apart, candidly you must think as I do? And, whether or no, at
      least you will be so obliging to do me the favour to find out from Lady
      Davenant if she really made the reply with her eyes open or not, and
      really meant what she said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen being quite clear that Lady Davenant always meant what she said, and
      had written with her eyes open, declined, as perfectly useless, making the
      proposed inquiry. It was plain that Lady Davenant had not thought proper
      to accept of this present, and to avoid any unpleasant explanations, had
      presumed it was not intended for her, but had been sent by mistake. Helen
      advised her to let the matter rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; said Lady Bearcroft, &ldquo;thank you, Miss Hanley, at all events
      for your good advice. But, neck or nothing, I am apt to go through with
      whatever I once take into my head, and, since you cannot aid and abet, I
      will trouble you no further, only not to say a word of what I have
      mentioned. But all the time I thank you, my dear young lady, as much as if
      I took your dictum. So, my dear Miss Hanley&mdash;Stanley&mdash;do not let
      me interrupt you longer in your book-hunt. Take care of that step-ladder,
      though; it is <i>coggledy</i>, as I observed when you came down&mdash;Good
      night, good night.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Helen, there is an end of every thing!&rdquo; cried Lady Cecilia, the
      next day, bursting into Helen&rsquo;s room, and standing before her with an air
      of consternation. &ldquo;What has brought things to this sad pass, I know not,&rdquo;
       continued she, &ldquo;for, but an hour before, I left every body in good-humour
      with themselves&mdash;all in good train. But now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;for you have not given me the least idea of what has
      happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I have not the least idea myself, my dear. All I know is, that
      something has gone wrong, dreadfully! between my mother and Lady
      Bearcroft. Mamma would not tell me what it is; but her indignation is at
      such a height she declares she will not see that <i>woman,</i> again:&mdash;positively
      will not come forth from her chamber as long as Lady Bearcroft remains in
      the house. So there is a total break up&mdash;and I wish I had never
      meddled with any thing. O that I had never brought together these
      unsuitabilities, these incompatibilities! Oh, Helen! what shall I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quite pale, Lady Cecilia stood, really in despair; and Helen did not know
      what to advise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know any thing about it, Helen, for you look as if you did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An abrupt knock at the door interrupted them, and, without waiting for
      permission, in came Lady Bearcroft, as if blown by a high wind, looking
      very red: half angry, half frightened, and then laughing, she exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;A
      fine <i>boggle-de-botch,</i> I have made of it!&rdquo; But seeing Lady Cecilia,
      she stopped short&mdash;&ldquo;Beg pardon&mdash;thought you were by yourself,
      Miss Hanley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia instantly offered to retire, yet intimated, as she moved
      towards the door, a wish to stay, and, if it were not too much, to ask
      what was meant by&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By <i>boggle-de-botch</i>, do you mean?&rdquo; said Lady Bearcroft. &ldquo;I am aware
      it is not a canonical word&mdash;classical, I mean; nor in nor out of any
      dictionary, perhaps&mdash;but when people are warm, they cannot stand
      picking terms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia; &ldquo;but what is the matter? I am sorry
      any thing unpleasant has occurred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unpleasant indeed!&rdquo; cried Lady Bearcroft; &ldquo;I have been treated actually
      like a dog, while paying a compliment too, and a very handsome compliment,
      beyond contradiction. Judge for yourself, Lady Cecilia, if this Sevigné is
      to be <i>sneezed at</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She opened the case; Lady Cecilia said the diamonds were certainly very
      handsome, but&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But!&rdquo; repeated Lady Bearcroft, &ldquo;I grant you there may be a but to
      everything in life; still it might be said civilly, as you say it, Lady
      Cecilia, or looked civilly, as you look it, Miss Hanley: and if that had
      been done, instead of being affronted, I might after all have been well
      enough pleased to pocket my diamonds; but nobody can without compunction
      pocket an affront.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia was sure her mother could not mean any affront.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I do not know what she could or could not mean; but I will tell you
      what she did&mdash;all but threw the diamonds in my face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; cried Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possible&mdash;and I will show you how, Miss Hanley. This way: just shut
      down the case&mdash;snap!&mdash;and across the table she threw it, just as
      you would deal a card in a passion, only with a Mrs. Siddons&rsquo; air to boot.
      I beg your pardons, both ladies, for mimicking your friend and your
      parent, but flesh and blood could not stand that sort of style, you know,
      and a little wholesome mimicry breaks no bones, and is not very offensive,
      I hope?&rdquo; The mimicry could not indeed be very offensive, for the imitation
      was so utterly unlike the reality, that Lady Cecilia and Helen with
      difficulty repressed their smiles. &ldquo;Ladies may smile, but they would smile
      on the wrong sides of their pretty little mouths if they had been treated
      as I have been&mdash;so ignominiously. I am sure I wish I had taken your
      advice, Miss Hanley; but the fact was, last night I did not quite believe
      you: I thought you were only saying the best you could to set off a
      friend; for, since I have been among the great, and indeed even when I
      lived with the little, I have met with so many fair copies of false
      countenances, that I could not help suspecting there might be something of
      that sort with your Lady Davenant, but I am entirely convinced all you
      told me is true, for I peeped quite close at her, lifted up the hood, and
      found there were not two faces under it&mdash;only one very angry one for
      my pains. But I declare I would rather see that than a double one, like my
      Lady Masham&rsquo;s, with her spermaceti smile. And after all, do you know,&rdquo;
       continued Lady Bearcroft in a right vulgarly-cordial tone&mdash;&ldquo;Do you
      know now, really, the first anger over, I like Lady Davenant&mdash;I
      protest and vow, even her pride I like&mdash;it well became her&mdash;birth
      and all, for I hear she is straight from Charlemagne! But I was going to
      mention, now my recollection is coming to me, that when I began talking to
      her ladyship of Sir Ben&rsquo;s gratitude about that place she got for him, she
      cut me short with her queer look, and said she was sure that Lord Davenant
      (and if he had been the king himself, instead of only her husband, and
      your father, Lady Cecilia, she could not have pronounced his name with
      more distinction)&mdash;she was sure, she said, that Lord Davenant would
      not have been instrumental in obtaining that place for Sir Benjamin
      Bearcroft if he had known any man more worthy of it, which indeed I did
      not think at the time over and above civil&mdash;for where, then, was the
      particular compliment to Sir Ben?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when Lady Bearcroft saw Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s anxiety and real distress at
      her mother&rsquo;s indignant resolution, she, with surprising good-humour said,&mdash;&ldquo;I
      wish I could settle it for you, my dear. I cannot go away directly, which
      would be the best move, because Sir Benjamin has business here to-day with
      Lord Davenant&mdash;some job of his own, which must take place of any
      movements of mine, he being the more worthy gender.. But I will tell you
      what I can do, and will, and welcome. I will keep my room instead of your
      mother keeping hers; so you may run and tell Lady Davenant that she is a
      prisoner at large, with the range of the whole house, without any danger
      of meeting me, for I shall not stir till the carriage is at the door
      to-morrow morning, when she will not be up, for we will have it at six. I
      will tell Sir Benjamin, he is in a hurry back to town, and he always is.
      So all is right on my part. And go you to your mother, my dear Lady
      Cecilia, and settle her. I am glad to see you smile again; it is a pity
      you should ever do any thing else.&rdquo; It was not long before Cecilia
      returned, proclaiming, &ldquo;Peace, peace!&rdquo; She had made such an amusing report
      to her mother of all that Lady Bearcroft had said and done, and purposed
      to do, that Lady Davenant could not help seeing the whole in a ludicrous
      light, felt at once that it was beneath her serious notice, and that it
      would be unbecoming to waste indignation upon such a person. The result
      was, that she commissioned Helen to release Lady Bearcroft as soon as
      convenient, and to inform her that an act of oblivion was passed over the
      whole transaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been a shower, and it had cleared up. Lady Cecilia thought the
      sky looked bluer, and birds sang sweeter, and the air felt pleasanter than
      before the storm. &ldquo;Nothing like a storm,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;for clearing the air;
      nothing like a little honest hurricane. But with Lady Masham there never
      is anything like a little honest hurricane. It is all still and close with
      an indescribable volcano-like feeling; one is not sure of what one is
      standing upon. Do you know, Helen,&rdquo; continued she, &ldquo;I am quite afraid of
      some explosion between mamma and Lady Masham. If we came to any difficulty
      with her, we could not get out of it quite so well as with Lady Bearcroft,
      for there is no resource of heart or frankness of feeling with her. Before
      we all meet at dinner, I must sound mamma, and see if all is tolerably
      safe.&rdquo; And when she went this day at dressing-time with a bouquet, as was
      her custom, for her mother, she took Helen with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the first hint of Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s fears, that Lady Masham could do her
      any mischief, Lady Davenant smiled in scorn. &ldquo;The will she may have, my
      dear, but she has not the power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is very foolish, to be sure,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia; &ldquo;still she might do
      mischief, and there is something monstrously treacherous in that smile of
      hers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monstrously!&rdquo; repeated Lady Davenant. &ldquo;No, no, my dear Cecilia; nothing
      monstrous. Leave to Lady Bearcroft the vulgar belief in court-bred
      monsters; we know there are no such things. Men and women there, as
      everywhere else, are what nature, education, and circumstances have made
      them. Once an age, once in half-a-dozen ages, nature may make a
      Brinvilliers, or art allow of a Zeluco; but, in general, monsters are mere
      fabulous creatures&mdash;mistakes often, from bad drawings, like the
      unicorn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mamma, yes; now I feel much more comfortable. The unicorn has
      convinced me,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia, laughing and singing
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">  &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis all a mere fable; there&rsquo;s nothing to fear.&lsquo;<br /></pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I shall think of her henceforth as nothing but what she appears to
      be, a well-dressed, well-bred, fine lady. Ay&mdash;every inch a fine lady;
      every word, look, motion, thought, suited to that <i>metier</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That vocation,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant; &ldquo;it is above a trade; with her it
      really is a sacred duty, not merely a pleasure, to be fine. She is a fine
      lady of the first order; nothing too professional in her manner&mdash;no
      obvious affectation, for affectation in her was so early wrought into
      habit as to have become second nature, scarcely distinguishable from real&mdash;all
      easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so, mamma; one gets on so easy with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A curious illusion,&rdquo; continued Lady Davenant, &ldquo;occurs with every one
      making acquaintance with such persons as Lady Masham, I have observed;
      perhaps it is that some sensation of the tread-mill life she leads,
      communicates itself to those she is talking to; which makes you fancy you
      are always getting on, but you never do get beyond a certain point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is exactly what I feel,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;while Lady Masham speaks, or
      while she listens, I almost wonder how she ever existed without me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and though one knows it is all an illusion,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia,
      &ldquo;still one is pleased, knowing all the time that she cannot possibly care
      for one in the least; but then one does not expect every body to care for
      one really; at least I know I cannot like all my acquaintance as much as
      my friends, much less can I love all my neighbours as myself&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come! Cecilia!&rdquo; said her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By &lsquo;come, come!&rsquo; mamma means, don&rsquo;t go any further, Cecilia,&rdquo; said she,
      turning to Helen. &ldquo;But now, mamma, I am not clear whether you really think
      her your friend or your enemy, inclined to do you mischief or not. Just as
      it may be for her interest or not, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And just as it may be the fashion or not,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant. &ldquo;I
      remember hearing old Lady&mdash;, one of the cleverest women of the last
      century, and one who had seen much of the world, say, &lsquo;If it was the
      fashion to burn me, and I at the stake, I hardly know ten persons of my
      acquaintance who would refuse to throw on a faggot.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh mamma!&mdash;Oh Lady Davenant!&rdquo; exclaimed Helen and Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a strong way of putting the matter,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant, laughing:&mdash;&ldquo;but
      fashion has, I assure you, more influence over weak minds, such as Lady
      Masham&rsquo;s, than either party or interest. And since you do not like my
      illustration by fire, take one by water&mdash;She is just a person to go
      out with, on a party of pleasure, on the smooth surface of a summer sea,
      and if a slight shower comes on would pity your bonnet sincerely, but if a
      serious squall arose and all should be in danger&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, of course, every body would take care of themselves,&rdquo; interrupted
      Lady Cecilia, &ldquo;excepting such a simpleton as Helen, who would take care of
      you first, mamma, of me next and of herself last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe it&mdash;I do believe it,&rdquo; cried Lady Davenant, and, her eyes
      and thoughts fixing upon Helen, she quite forgot what further she was
      going to say of Lady Masham.
    </p>
    <p>
      The perfectly unimpassioned tone, in which her mother had discussed this
      lady&rsquo;s character, even the candour, convinced Lady Cecilia as well as
      Helen, that nothing further could be done as to drawing them together. No
      condescension of manner, no conciliation, could be expected from Lady
      Davenant towards Lady Masham, but at the same time there was no fear of
      any rupture. And to this humble consolation was Lady Cecilia brought. She
      told Helen that she gave up all hope of doing any good, she would now be
      quite content if she avoided doing harm, and if this visit ended without
      coming to any further outrage on the part of Lady Bearcroft, and without
      her mother&rsquo;s being <i>guilty of contempt</i> to Lady Masham. She had done
      some little service, however, with respect to the ambassadress, and her
      mother knew it. It was well known that the ambassadress governed the
      ambassador, and Lady Cecilia had quite won her heart, &ldquo;so that he will be
      assuredly a friend to papa. Indeed, this has been almost promised. Madame
      l&rsquo;Ambassadrice assured me that her husband looks upon Lord Davenant as one
      of the first sages of England, that is to say, of Europe; and she says he
      is well acquainted with all Lord Davenant&rsquo;s works&mdash;and it is my
      belief,&rdquo; concluded Lady Cecilia, &ldquo;that all Sir William Davenant&rsquo;s works go
      with her to papa&rsquo;s credit, for as she spoke she gave a polite glance
      towards the bookcase where she saw their gilded backs, and I found the
      ambassador himself, afterwards, with &lsquo;Davenant on Trade&rsquo; in his hand! Be
      it so: it is not, after all, you know, robbing the dead, only inheriting
      by mistake from a namesake, which with foreigners is allowable, because
      impossible to avoid, from the time of <i>&lsquo;Monsieur Robinson parent
      apparemment de Monsieur Crusoe?&rsquo;&rsquo;</i> to the present day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By dint of keeping well asunder those who would not draw well together,
      Lady Cecilia did contrive to get through the remaining morning of this
      operose visit; some she sent out to drive with gallant military outriders
      to see places in the neighbourhood famed for this or that; others walked
      or boated, or went through the customary course of conservatories,
      pheasantry, flower-garden, pleasure-grounds, and best views of Clarendon
      Park&mdash;and billiards always. The political conferences were held in
      Lord Davenant&rsquo;s apartment: to what these conferences tended we never knew
      and never shall; we consider them as matters of history, and leave them
      with due deference to the historian; we have to do only with biography.
      Far be it from us to meddle with politics&mdash;we have quite enough to do
      with manners and morality.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next day, as Helen was going across the hall, she saw the members of
      the last political conclave coming out of Lord Davenant&rsquo;s room, each
      looking as if the pope had not been chosen according to his wish&mdash;dark
      and disappointed; even Mr. Harley&rsquo;s radiant countenance was dimmed, and
      the dry symptomatic cough which he gave after taking leave of Lady
      Davenant, convinced Helen that all was not well within. He departed, and
      there seemed to be among those who remained a greater constraint than
      ever. There appeared to be in each an awakened sense that there were
      points on which they could never agree; all seemed to feel how different
      it would have been if Mr. Harley had remained. True, the absence or
      presence of a person of genius makes as much difference in the whole
      appearance of things, as sunshine or no sunshine on the landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner, however, was got through, for time and the hour, two hours, or
      three, will get through the roughest dinner or the smoothest. &ldquo;Never saw a
      difficult dinner-party better bothered!&rdquo; was Lady Bearcroft&rsquo;s compliment,
      whispered to Cecilia as they went into the drawing-room; and Helen,
      notwithstanding Lady Bearcroft&rsquo;s vulgarity, could not help beginning
      absolutely to like her for her good nature and amazingly prompt sympathy;
      but, after all, good nature without good manners is but a blundering ally,
      dangerous to its best friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      This evening, Lady Cecilia felt that every one was uncomfortable, and,
      flitting about the room, she touched here and there to see how things were
      going on. They were not going on well, and she could not make them better;
      even her efforts at conciliation were ineffectual; she had stepped in
      between her mother, some of the gentlemen, and the general, in an argument
      in which she heard indications of strife, and she set about to explain
      away contradictions, and to convince every body that they were really all
      of the same opinion. With her sweet voice and pretty persuasive look, this
      might have done for the general, as a relaxing smile seemed to promise;
      but it would not do at all with Lady Davenant, who, from feelings foreign
      to the present matter, was irritated, and spoke, as Helen thought, too
      harshly:&mdash;&ldquo;Cecilia, you would act Harmony in the comedy to
      perfection; but, unfortunately, I am not one of those persons who can be
      persuaded that when I say one thing I mean quite another&mdash;probably
      because it is not my practice so to do. That old epigram, Sir Benjamin, do
      you know it,&rdquo; continued she, &ldquo;which begins with a bankrupt&rsquo;s roguish
      &lsquo;Whereas?&rsquo; 
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">  &ldquo;Whereas the religion and fate of three nations<br />  Depend on th&rsquo; importance of our conversations:<br />  Whereas some objections are thrown in our way,<br />  And words have been construed to mean what they say,&mdash;<br />  Be it known from henceforth to each friend and each brother,<br />  When&rsquo;er we say one thing we mean quite another."<br /></pre>
    <p>
      Sir Benjamin gravely remarked that it was good law practice. The courts
      themselves would be shut up if some such doctrine were not understood in
      the practice there, <i>subaudito,</i> if not publicly proclaimed with an
      absolute &ldquo;Whereas be it known from henceforth.&rdquo; Whether this was dry
      humour of Sir Benjamin&rsquo;s, or plain matter of fact and serious opinion, the
      gravity with which it was delivered indicated not; but it produced the
      good effect of a smile, a laugh, at him or with him. Lady Cecilia did not
      care which, the laugh was good at all events; her invincible good-nature
      and sweetness of temper had not been soured or conquered even by her
      mother&rsquo;s severity; and Lady Davenant, observing this, forgave and wished
      to be forgiven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dearest Cecilia,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;clasp this bracelet for me, will you? It
      would really be a national blessing, if, in the present times, all women
      were as amiable as you,
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
      &lsquo;Fond to spread friendships, but to cover heats.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, turning to a French gentleman, she spoke of the change she had
      observed when she was last at Paris, from the overwhelming violence of
      party spirit on all sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dreadfully true,&rdquo; the French gentleman replied&mdash;&ldquo;party spirit,
      taking every Proteus form, calling itself by a hundred names and with a
      thousand devices and watchwords, which would be too ridiculous, if they
      were not too terrible&mdash;domestic happiness destroyed, all society
      disordered, disorganised&mdash;literature not able to support herself,
      scarcely appearing in company&mdash;all precluded, superseded by the
      politics of the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Davenant joined with him in his regrets, and added, that she feared
      society in England would soon be brought to the same condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the French gentleman, &ldquo;English ladies will never be so vehement
      as my countrywomen; they will never become, I hope, like some of our lady
      politicians, &lsquo;<i>qui heurlent comme des demons</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia said that, from what she had seen at Paris, she was persuaded
      that if the ladies did bawl too loud it was because the gentlemen did not
      listen to them; that above half the party-violence which appeared in
      Parisian belles was merely dramatic, to produce a sensation, and draw the
      gentlemen, from the black <i>pelotons</i> in which they gathered, back to
      their proper positions round the <i>fauteuils</i> of the fair ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The foreigner, speaking to what he saw passing in Lady Davenant&rsquo;s mind,
      went on;&mdash;&ldquo;Ladies can do much, however, in this as in all other
      dilemmas where their power is, and ought to be, omnipotent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Female <i>influence</i> is and ought to be <i>potent,</i>&rdquo; said the
      general, with an emphasis on influence, contradistinguishing it from
      power, and reducing the exaggeration of omnipotent by the short process of
      lopping off two syllables.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So long as ladies keep in their own proper character,&rdquo; said Lady
      Davenant, &ldquo;all is well; but, if once they cease to act as women, that
      instant they lose their privilege&mdash;their charm: they forfeit their
      exorcising power; they can no longer command the demon of party nor
      themselves, and he transforms them directly, as you say,&rdquo; said she to the
      French gentleman, &ldquo;into actual furies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, when so transformed, sometimes unconscious of their state,&rdquo; said the
      general, drily, his eye glancing towards the other end of the room, and
      lighting upon Lady Bearcroft, who was at the instant very red and very
      loud; and Lady Cecilia was standing, as if watchful for a moment&rsquo;s pause,
      in which to interpose her word of peace. She waited for some time in vain,
      for when she hastened from the other end of the room to this&mdash;the
      scene of action, things had come to such a pass between the ladies Masham
      and Bearcroft, that mischief, serious mischief, must have ensued, had not
      Lady Cecilia, at utmost need, summoned to her aid the happy genius of
      Nonsense&mdash;the genius of Nonsense, in whose elfin power even Love
      delights; on whom Reason herself condescends often to smile, even when
      Logic frowns, and chops him on his block: but cut in twain, the ethereal
      spirit soon unites again, and lives, and laughs. But mark him well&mdash;this
      little happy genius of Nonsense; see that he be the true thing&mdash;the
      genuine spirit. You will know him by his well-bred air and tone, which
      none can counterfeit; and by his smile; for while most he makes others
      laugh, the arch little rogue seldom goes beyond a smile himself! Graceful
      in the midst of all his pranks, he never goes too far&mdash;though far
      enough he has been known to go&mdash;he has crept into the armour of the
      great hero, convulsed the senate in the wig of a chancellor, and
      becomingly, decorously, put on now and then the mitre of an archbishop.
      &ldquo;If good people,&rdquo; said Archbishop Usher, &ldquo;would but make goodness
      agreeable, and smile, instead of frowning in their virtue, how many they
      would win to the good cause!&rdquo; Lady Cecilia in this was good at need, and
      at her utmost need, obedient to her call, came this happy little genius,
      and brought with him song and dance, riddle and charade, and comic prints;
      and on a half-opened parcel of books Cecilia darted, and produced a Comic
      Annual, illustrated by him whom no risible muscles can resist. All smiled
      who understood, and mirth admitted of her crew all who smiled, and
      party-spirit fled. But there were foreigners present. Foreigners cannot
      well understand our local allusions; our Cruikshank is to them
      unintelligible, and Hood&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sorrows of Number One&rdquo; quite lost upon them.
      Then Lady Bearcroft thought she would do as much as Lady Cecilia, and more&mdash;that
      she would produce what these poor foreigners could comprehend. But not at
      her call came the genius of lively nonsense, he heard her not. In his
      stead came that counterfeit, who thinks it witty to be rude:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">  &ldquo;And placing raillery in railing,<br />  Will tell aloud your greatest failing&mdash;&ldquo;<br /></pre>
    <p>
      that vulgar imp yclept Fun&mdash;known by his broad grin, by his loud
      tone, and by his rude banter. Head foremost forcing himself in, came he,
      and brought with him a heap of coarse caricatures, and they were party
      caricatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capital!&rdquo; Lady Bearcroft, however, pronounced them, as she spread all
      upon the table for applause&mdash;but no applause ensued.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not such, these, as real good English humour produces and enjoys,
      independently of party&mdash;these were all too broad, too coarse. Lady
      Davenant despised, the general detested. Helen turned away, and Lady
      Cecilia threw them under the table, that they might not be seen by the
      foreigners. &ldquo;For the honour of England, do not let them be spread abroad,
      pray, Lady Bearcroft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The world is grown mighty nice!&rdquo; said Lady Bearcroft; &ldquo;for my part, give
      me a good laugh when it is to be had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps we shall find one here,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia, opening a portfolio
      of caricatures in a different style, but they were old, and Lady Bearcroft
      would have thrown them aside; but Lord Davenant observed that, if they
      have lasted so long,&mdash;they must be good, because their humour only
      can ensure their permanence; the personality dies with the person: for
      instance, in the famous old print of the minister rat-catcher, in the
      Westminster election, the likeness to each rat of the day is lost to us,
      but the ridicule on placemen ratters remains. The whole, however, is
      perfectly incomprehensible to foreigners. &ldquo;Rats! rat!&rdquo; repeated one of the
      foreigners, as he looked at and studied the print. It was amusing to see
      the gravity with which this foreign diplomatist, quite new to England,
      listened to Lady Bearcroft&rsquo;s explanation of what is meant in English by a
      <i>rat political</i>. She was at first rather good on this topic,
      professing a supernatural acuteness of the senses, arising from an
      unconquerable antipathy, born with her, to the whole race of <i>rats</i>.
      She declared that she could see a rat a mile off in any man&mdash;could,
      from the moment a man opened his mouth in parliament, or on the hustings,
      prophesy whether he would turn into a rat at last, or not. She, moreover,
      understood the language of rats of every degree, and knew even when they
      said &ldquo;No,&rdquo; that they meant &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;&mdash;two monosyllables, the test of
      rats, which betray them all sooner or later, and transform the biped into
      the quadruped, who then turns tail, and runs always to the other side,
      from whatever side he may be of.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>chargé-d&rsquo;affaires</i> stood in half bow, lending deferential ear
      and serious attention the whole time of this lecture upon rats, without
      being able from beginning to end to compass its meaning, and at the close,
      with a disconsolate shrug, he exclaimed, &ldquo;<i>Ah! Je renonce à ça</i>&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Bearcroft went on&mdash;&ldquo;Since I cannot make your excellency
      understand by description what I mean by an English rat-political, I must
      give you an example or two, dead and living&mdash;living best, and I have
      more than one noted and branded rat in my eye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Lady Cecilia, anxious to interrupt this perilous business, hastily
      rang for wine and water; and as the gentlemen went to help themselves she
      gave them a general toast, as sitting down to the piano-forte, to the tune
      of&mdash;&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to the maiden of blushing fifteen&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      She sang&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to rats and ratcatchers of every degree,<br />  The rat that is trapped, and the rat that is free,<br />  The rat that is shy, sir, the rat that is bold, sir,<br />  The rat upon sale, sir, the rat that is sold, sir.<br />  Let the rats rat! Success to them all,<br />  And well off to the old ones before the house fall!&rdquo;<br /></pre>

      CHAPTER XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sir Benjamin and Lady Bearcroft departed at six o&rsquo;clock the next morning,
      and all the rest of the political and diplomatic corps <i>left</i>
      immediately after breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Davenant looked relieved, the general satisfied, and Lady Cecilia
      consoled herself with the hope that, if she had done no good, she had not
      done any harm. This was a bad slide, perhaps, in the magic lantern, but
      would leave no trace behind. She began now to be very impatient for
      Beauclerc&rsquo;s appearance; always sanguine, and as rapid in her conclusions
      as she was precipitate in her actions, she felt no doubt, no anxiety, as
      to the future; for, though she refrained from questioning Helen as to her
      sentiments for Beauclerc, she was pretty well satisfied on that subject.
      Helen was particularly grateful to Lady Cecilia for this forbearance,
      being almost ashamed to own, even to herself, how exceedingly happy she
      felt; and now that it was no longer wrong in her to love, or dishonourable
      in him to wish to be loved, she was surprised to find how completely the
      idea of Beauclerc was connected with and interwoven through all her
      thoughts, pursuits, and sentiments. He had certainly been constantly in
      her company for several months, a whole summer, but she could scarcely
      believe that during this time he could have become so necessary to her
      happiness. While, with still increasing agitation, she looked forward to
      his arrival, she felt as if Lady Davenant&rsquo;s presence was a sort of
      protection, a something to rely on, in the new circumstances in which she
      was to be placed. Lord Davenant had returned to town, but Lady Davenant
      remained. The Russian embassy seemed still in abeyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning as Helen was sitting in Lady Davenant&rsquo;s room alone with her,
      she said suddenly: &ldquo;At your age, Helen, I had as little taste for what are
      called politics as you have, yet you see what I am come to, and by the
      same road you may, you will, arrive at the same point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I! oh, I hope not!&rdquo; cried Helen, almost before she felt the whole
      inference that might be drawn from this exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hope not?&rdquo; repeated her ladyship calmly. &ldquo;Let us consider this matter
      rationally, and put our hopes, and our fears, and our prejudices out of
      the question, if possible. Let me observe to you, that the position of
      women in society is somewhat different from what it was a hundred years
      ago, or as it was sixty, or I will say thirty years since. Women are now
      so highly cultivated, and political subjects are at present of so much
      importance, of such high interest, to all human creatures who live
      together in society, you can hardly expect, Helen, that you, as a rational
      being, can go through the world as it now is, without forming any opinion
      on points of public importance. You cannot, I conceive, satisfy yourself
      with the common namby-pamby little missy phrase, &lsquo;ladies have nothing to
      do with politics.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen blushed, for she was conscious that, wrong or right, namby-pamby,
      little missy, or not, she had hitherto satisfied herself very comfortably
      with some such thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Depend upon it, Helen,&rdquo; resumed Lady Davenant, &ldquo;that when you are
      married, your love for a man of superior abilities, and of superior
      character, must elevate your mind to sympathy with all his pursuits, with
      all the subjects which claim his attention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen felt that she must become strongly interested in every subject in
      which the man she loved was interested; but still she observed that she
      had not abilities or information, like Lady Davenant&rsquo;s, that could justify
      her in attempting to follow her example. Besides, Helen was sure that,
      even if she had, it would not suit her taste; and besides, in truth, she
      did not think it well suited to a woman&mdash;she stopped when she came to
      that last thought. But what kindness and respect suppressed was clearly
      understood by her penetrating friend. Fixing her eyes upon Helen, she said
      with a smile, the candour and nobleness of her character rising above all
      little irritation of temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree with you, my dear Helen, in all you do <i>not</i> say, and were I
      to begin life over again, my conduct should in some respects be different.
      Of the public dangers and private personal inconveniences that may result
      from women becoming politicians, or, as you better express our meaning
      interfering, with public affairs, no one can be more aware than I am. <i>Interfering</i>,
      observe I say, for I would mark and keep the line between influence and
      interference. Female influence must, will, and ought to exist on political
      subjects as on all others; but this influence should always be domestic,
      not public&mdash;the customs of society have so ruled it. Of the thorns in
      the path of ambitious men all moralists talk, but there are little,
      scarcely visible, thorns of a peculiar sort that beset the path of an
      ambitious woman, the venomous prickles of the <i>domestic bramble</i>, a
      plant not perhaps mentioned in Withering&rsquo;s Botany, or the Hortus Kewensis,
      but it is too well known to many, and to me it has been sorely known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this instant General Clarendon came in with some letters, which had
      been forwarded to him express. One, for Lady Davenant, he had been desired
      to put into her hands himself: he retired, and Lady Davenant opened the
      letter. By the first glance at her countenance, Helen saw that there was
      something in it which had surprised and given her great concern. Helen
      withdrew her eyes, and waited till she should speak. But Lady Davenant was
      quite silent, and Helen, looking at her again, saw her put her hand to her
      heart, as if from some sudden sense of violent bodily pain, and she sank
      on the sofa, fell back, and became as pale as death and motionless.
      Excessively frightened, Helen threw open the window, rang the bell for
      Lady Davenant&rsquo;s own woman, and sent the page for Lady Cecilia. In a few
      moments Lady Cecilia and Elliott came. Neither was as much alarmed as
      Helen had expected they would be. They had seen Lady Davenant, under
      similar attacks&mdash;they knew what remedies to apply. Elliott was a
      remarkably composed, steady person. She now went on doing all that was
      necessary without speaking a word. The paroxysm lasted longer than usual,
      as Lady Cecilia observed; and, though she continued her assurances to
      Helen that &ldquo;It was all nervous&mdash;only nerves,&rdquo; she began evidently to
      be herself alarmed. At length symptoms of returning animation appeared,
      and then Cecilia retired, beckoning to Helen to follow her into the next
      room. &ldquo;We had better leave mamma to Elliott, she will be happier if she
      thinks we know nothing of the matter.&rdquo; Then, recollecting that Helen had
      been in the room when this attack came on, she added&mdash;&ldquo;But no, you
      must go back, for mamma will remember that you were present&mdash;take as
      little notice, however, as possible of what has happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia said that her mother, when they were abroad, had been subject to
      such seizures at intervals, &ldquo;and in former times, before I was born, I
      believe,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia, &ldquo;she had some kind of extraordinary disease
      in the heart; but she has a particular aversion to being thought nervous.
      Every physician who has ever pronounced her nervous has always displeased
      her, and has been dismissed. She was once quite vexed with me for barely
      suggesting the idea. There,&rdquo; cried Cecilia, &ldquo;I hear her voice, go to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen followed Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s suggestion, and took as little notice as
      possible of what had happened. Elliott disappeared as she entered&mdash;the
      page was waiting at the door, but to Helen&rsquo;s satisfaction Lady Davenant
      did not admit him. &ldquo;Not yet; tell him I will ring when I want him,&rdquo; said
      she. The door closed: and Lady Davenant, turning to Helen, said, &ldquo;Whether
      I live or die is a point of some consequence to the friends who love me;
      but there is another question, Helen, of far more importance to me, and, I
      trust, to them. That question is, whether I continue to live as I have
      lived, honoured and respected, or live and die dishonoured and despised,&rdquo;&mdash;her
      eye glanced towards the letter she had been reading. &ldquo;My poor child,&rdquo;
       continued Lady Davenant, looking at Helen&rsquo;s agitated countenance,&mdash;&ldquo;My
      poor child, I will not keep you in suspense.&rdquo; She then told Helen that she
      was suspected of having revealed a secret of state that had been confided
      to her husband, and which it was supposed, and truly supposed, that Lord
      Davenant had told to her. Beyond its political importance, the disclosure
      involved a charge of baseness, in her having betrayed confidence, having
      suffered a copy of a letter from an illustrious personage to be handed
      about and read by several people. &ldquo;Lord Davenant as yet knows nothing of
      this, the effect upon him is what I most dread. I cannot show you this,&rdquo;
       continued she, opening again the letter she had just received, &ldquo;because it
      concerns others as well as myself. I am, at all events, under obligations
      that can never be forgotten to the person who gave me this timely notice,
      which could no otherwise have reached me, and the person to whom I am thus
      obliged is one, Helen, whom neither you nor I like, and whom Cecilia
      particularly dislikes&mdash;Miss Clarendon! Her manner of doing me this
      service is characteristic: she begins,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Miss Clarendon is aware that Lady Davenant has no liking for her, but
      that shall not prevent Miss Clarendon from doing what she thinks an act of
      justice towards a noble character falsely attacked.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;Lady Davenant
      read no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had not you better wait till you are stronger, my dear Lady Davenant!&rdquo;
       said Helen, seeing her prepare to write.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was once said, gloriously well,&rdquo; replied Lady Davenant, &ldquo;that the
      duties of life are more than life itself&mdash;so I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While she wrote, Helen thought of what she had just heard, and she
      ventured to interrupt Lady Davenant to ask if she had formed any idea of
      the means by which the secret could have been betrayed&mdash;or the copy
      of the letter obtained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, she had a suspicion of one person, the diplomatist to whom Mr. Harley
      had shown such a mortal antipathy. She recollected that the last morning
      the <i>Congress</i> had sat in Lord Davenant&rsquo;s cabinet, she had left her
      writing-desk there, and this letter was in it; she thought that she had
      locked the desk when she had left the room, it certainly was fast when she
      returned, but it had a spring Bramah lock, and its being shut down would
      have fastened it. She had no proof one way or other, her suspicion rested
      where was her instinctive dislike. It was remarkable, however, that she at
      once did justice to another person whom she did not like, Mr. Mapletofft,
      Lord Davenant&rsquo;s secretary. &ldquo;His manners do not please me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but
      I have perfect confidence in his integrity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen felt and admired this generous candour, but her suspicions were not
      of the diplomatist alone: she thought of one who might perhaps have been
      employed by him&mdash;Carlos the page. And many circumstances, which she
      recollected and put together, now strengthened this suspicion. She
      wondered it had not occurred to Lady Davenant; she thought it must, but
      that she did not choose to mention it. Helen had often heard Lady
      Davenant&rsquo;s particular friends complain that it was extremely disagreeable
      to them to have this boy constantly in the room, whatever might be the
      conversation. There was the page, either before or behind a screen, always
      within hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Davenant said that, as Carlos was a Portuguese, and had never been in
      England till she had brought him over, a few months before, he could not
      understand English well enough to comprehend what was going on. This was
      doubted, especially by Helen, who had watched his countenance, and had
      represented her doubts and her reasons for them to Lady Davenant, but she
      was not convinced. It was one of the few points on which she could justly
      be reproached with adhering to her fancy instead of listening to reason.
      The more Carlos was attacked, the more she adhered to him. In fact, it was
      not so much because he was a favourite, as because he was a <i>protegé</i>;
      he was completely dependent upon her protection: she had brought him to
      England, had saved him from his mother, a profligate camp-follower, had
      freed him from the most miserable condition possible, and had raised him
      to easy, happy, confidential life. To the generous the having conferred an
      obligation is in itself a tie hard to sever. All noble-minded people
      believe in fidelity, and never doubt of gratitude; they throw their own
      souls into those they oblige, and think and feel for them, as they, in
      their situation, would think and feel. Lady Davenant considered it an
      injustice to doubt the attachment of this boy, and a cruelty she deemed it
      to suspect him causelessly of being the most base of human creatures&mdash;he,
      a young defenceless orphan. Helen had more than once offended, by
      attempting to stop Lady Davenant from speaking imprudently before Carlos;
      she was afraid, even at this moment, to irritate her by giving utterance
      to her doubts; she determined, therefore, to keep them to herself till she
      had some positive grounds for her suspicions. She resolved to watch the
      boy very carefully. Presently, having finished her letters, Lady Davenant
      rang for him. Helen&rsquo;s eyes were upon Carlos the moment he entered, and her
      thoughts did not escape observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are wrong, Helen,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant, as she lighted the taper to
      seal her letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I am not right,&rdquo; said Helen, keeping her eyes upon the boy&rsquo;s changing
      countenance, &ldquo;I am too suspicious&mdash;but observe, am I not right, at
      this instant, in thinking that his countenance is <i>bad?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Davenant could not but see that countenance change in an
      extraordinary manner, in spite of his efforts to keep it steady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cause that of which you complain,&rdquo; said she, going on sealing her
      letters deliberately. &ldquo;In courts of public justice, and in private
      equity,&rdquo; the word <i>equity</i> she pronounced with an austere emphasis,
      &ldquo;how often is the change of countenance misinterpreted. The sensibility of
      innocence, that cannot bear to be suspected, is often mistaken for the
      confusion worse confounded of guilt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen observed, that, as Lady Davenant spoke, and spoke in his favour, the
      boy&rsquo;s countenance cleared up; that vacillating expression of fear, and
      consciousness of having something within him unwhipt of justice,
      completely disappeared, and his whole air was now bold and open&mdash;towards
      Helen, almost an air of defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think is the cause of this change in his countenance&mdash;you
      observe it, do you not?&rdquo; asked Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and the cause is as plain as the change. He sees I do not suspect
      him, though you do; and seeing, Helen, that he has at least one friend in
      the world, who will do him justice, the orphan boy takes courage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could be as good as you are, my dearest Lady Davenant,&rdquo; said
      Helen; &ldquo;but I cannot help still feeling, and saying,&mdash;I doubt. Now
      observe him, while I speak; I will turn my eyes away, that my terrible
      looks may not confound him. You say he knows that you do not suspect him,
      and that I do. How does he know it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How!&rdquo; said Lady Davenant. &ldquo;By the universal language of the eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not only by that universal language, I think,&rdquo; said Helen; &ldquo;but I suspect
      he understands every word we say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen, without ever looking up from a bunch of seals which she was rubbing
      bright, slowly and very distinctly added,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that he can speak, read, and write English.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A change in the countenance of Carlos appeared, notwithstanding all his
      efforts to hold his features in the same position; instead of placid
      composure there was now grim rigidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me the great seal with the coat of arms on it,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant,
      dropping the wax on her letter, and watching the boy&rsquo;s eye as she spoke,
      without herself looking towards the seal she had described. He never
      stirred, and Helen began to fear she was unjust and suspicious. But again
      her doubts, at least of his disposition, occurred: as she was passing
      through Lady Davenant&rsquo;s dressing-room with her, when they were going down
      to dinner, the page following them, Helen caught his figure in a mirror,
      and saw that he was making a horrible grimace at her behind her back, his
      dark countenance expressing extreme hatred and revenge. Helen touched Lady
      Davenant&rsquo;s arm, but, before her eye could be directed to the glass,
      Carlos, perceiving that he was observed, pretended to be suddenly seized
      with the cramp in his foot, which obliged him to make these frightful
      contortions. Helen was shocked by his artfulness, but it succeeded with
      Lady Davenant: it was in vain to say more about it to her, so Helen let it
      pass. When she mentioned it afterwards to Lady Cecilia, she said&mdash;&ldquo;I
      am sorry, for your sake, Helen, that this happened; depend upon it, that
      revengeful little Portuguese gnome will work you mischief some time or
      other.&rdquo; Helen did not think of herself&mdash;indeed she could not imagine
      any means by which he could possibly work her woe; but the face was so
      horrible, that it came again and again before her eyes, and she was more
      and more determined to watch Carlos constantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was one of the public days at Clarendon Park, on which there was a
      good deal of company; many of the neighbouring gentry were to be at
      dinner. When Lady Davenant appeared, no inquiries concerning her health
      were made by her daughter or by the general&mdash;no allusion to her
      having been unwell. She seemed quite recovered, and Helen observed that
      she particularly exerted herself, and that her manner was more gracious
      than usual to commonplace people&mdash;more present to everything that was
      passing. She retired however early, and took Helen with her. The
      depression of her spirits, or rather the weight upon her mind, appeared
      again as soon as they were alone together. She took her writing-desk, and
      looked over some letters which she said ought to be burned. She could not
      sleep in peace, she said&mdash;she ought not to sleep, till this was done.
      Several of these, as she looked over them, seemed to give her pain, and
      excited her indignation or contempt as she from time to time exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;Meanness!&mdash;corruption!&mdash;ingratitude
      too!&mdash;all favours forgotten! To see&mdash;to feel this&mdash;is the
      common fate of all who have lived the life I have lived; of this I am not
      so inconsistent as to complain. But it is hard that my own character&mdash;the
      integrity of a whole life&mdash;should avail me nothing! And yet,&rdquo; added
      she, after a moment&rsquo;s pause of reflection, &ldquo;to how few can my character be
      really known! Women cannot, like men, make their characters known by
      public actions. I have no right to complain; but if Lord Davenant&rsquo;s honour
      is to be&mdash;&rdquo; She paused; her thoughts seeming too painful for
      utterance. She completed the arrangement of the papers, and, as she
      pressed down the lid of her writing-box, and heard the closing sound of
      the lock, she said,&mdash;&ldquo;Now I may sleep in peace.&rdquo; She put out the
      lamp, and went to her bed-room, carrying with her two or three books which
      she intended to read after she should be in bed; for, though she talked of
      sleeping, it was plain she thought she should not. Helen prevailed upon
      her to let her remain with her, and read to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened first a volume of Shakspeare, in which was Lady Davenant&rsquo;s
      mark. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;read that speech of Wolsey&rsquo;s; read that whole
      scene, the finest picture of ambition ever drawn.&rdquo; And, after she had
      heard the scene, she observed that there is no proof more certain of the
      truth of poetic description, than its recurring to us at the time we
      strongly feel. &ldquo;Those who tell us,&rdquo; continued she, &ldquo;that it is unnatural
      to recollect poetry or eloquence at times of powerful emotion, are much
      mistaken; they have not strong feelings or strong imaginations. I can
      affirm from my own experience, that it is perfectly natural.&rdquo; Lady
      Davenant rapidly mentioned some instances of this sort which she
      recollected, but seeing the anxiety of Helen&rsquo;s look, she added, &ldquo;You are
      afraid that I am feverish; you wish me to rest; then, go on reading to
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen read on, till Lady Davenant declared she would not let her sit up
      any longer. &ldquo;Only, before you go, my dear child, look here at what I have
      been looking at while you have been reading.&rdquo; She made Helen place herself
      so as to see exactly in the same direction and light in which she was
      looking, and she pointed out to her, in the lining of the bed, a place
      where, from the falling of the folds and the crinkles in the material, a
      figure with the head, head-dress, and perfect profile of an old woman with
      a turned-up chin, appeared. At first Helen could not see it; but at last
      she caught it, and was struck with it. &ldquo;The same sort of curious effect of
      chance resemblance and coincidence which painters, Leonardo da Vinci in
      particular, have observed in the moss and stains on old stones,&rdquo; observed
      Lady Davenant. &ldquo;But it struck me to-night, Helen, perhaps because I am a
      little feverish&mdash;it struck me in a new point of view&mdash;moral, not
      picturesque. If such be the effects of chance, or of coincidence, how
      cautious we should be in deciding from appearances, or pronouncing from
      circumstantial evidence upon the guilt of evil design in any human
      creature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean this to apply to me about Carlos?&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do. But not only of him and you was I thinking, but of myself and those
      who judge of me falsely from coincidences, attributing to me designs which
      I never had, and actions of which I am incapable.&rdquo; She suddenly raised
      herself in her bed, and was going to say more, but the pendule striking at
      that instant two o&rsquo;clock, she stopped abruptly, kissed Helen, and sent her
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen gathered together and carried away with her all the books, that Lady
      Davenant might not be tempted to look at them more. As she had several
      piled on one arm, and had a taper in her hand, she was somewhat
      encumbered, and, though she managed to open the bed-room door, and to shut
      it again without letting any of the books fall, and crossed the little
      ante-room between the bed-chamber and dressing-room safely, yet, as she
      was opening the dressing-room door, and taking too much or too little care
      of some part of her pyramid of books, down came the whole pile with a
      noise which, in the stillness of the night, sounded tremendous. She was
      afraid it would disturb Lady Davenant, and was going back to tell her what
      it was, when she was startled by hearing, as she thought, the moving of a
      chair or table in the dressing-room: she stopped short to listen&mdash;all
      was silent; she thought she had mistaken the direction in which the noise
      came.
    </p>
    <p>
      She softly opened the dressing-room door, and looked in&mdash;all was
      silent&mdash;no chair, or stool, or table overturned, every thing was in
      its place exactly as they had left it, but there was a strong smell of a
      half extinguished lamp: she thought it had been put out when they had left
      the room, she now supposed it had not been sufficiently lowered, she
      turned the screw, and took care now to see it completely extinguished;
      then went back for the books, and as people sometimes will, when most
      tired and most late, be most orderly, she would not go to bed without
      putting every volume in its place in the book-case. After reaching to put
      one book upon the highest shelf, as she was getting down she laid her hand
      on the top of Lady Davenant&rsquo;s writing-box, and, as she leaned on it, was
      surprised to hear the click of its lock closing. The sound was so peculiar
      she could not be mistaken; besides, she thought she had felt the lid give
      way under her pressure. There was no key left in the lock&mdash;she
      perfectly recollected the very sound of that click when Lady Davenant shut
      the lid down before leaving the room this night. She stood looking at the
      lock, and considering how this could be, and as she remained perfectly
      still, she heard, or thought she heard some one breathing near her.
      Holding in her own breath, she listened and cautiously looked round
      without stirring from the place where she stood&mdash;one of the window
      curtains moved, so at least she thought&mdash;yes, certainly there was
      some living thing behind it. It might be Lady Davenant&rsquo;s great dog; but
      looking again at the bottom of the curtain she saw a human foot. The page,
      Carlos! was her instant suspicion, and his vengeful face came before her,
      and a vision of a stiletto! or she did not well know what. She trembled
      all over; yet she had presence of mind enough to recollect that she should
      not seem to take notice. And, while she moved about the books on the
      table, she gave another look, and saw that the foot was not withdrawn. She
      knew she was safe still, it had not been perceived that she had seen it;
      now what was she to do? &ldquo;Go up to that curtain and draw it back and face
      the boy&rdquo;&mdash;but she did not dare; yet he was only a boy&mdash;But it
      might be a man and not the page. Better go and call somebody&mdash;tell
      Lady Davenant. She MUST go through the antechamber, and pass close to that
      curtain to open the door. All this was the thought of one moment, and she
      went on holding up the light to the book-shelves as if in quest of some
      book, and kept coasting along to gain the door; she was afraid when she
      was to pass the window-curtain, either of touching it, or of stumbling
      over that foot. But she got past without touching or stumbling, opened the
      door, whisked through&mdash;that was done too quickly, but she could not
      help it,&mdash;she shut, bolted the door, and ran across the ante-chamber
      to Lady Davenant&rsquo;s bed-room. She entered softly, aware of the danger to
      her of sudden alarm. But Lady Davenant was not asleep, was not alarmed,
      but was <i>effective</i> in a moment. First she asked:&mdash;&ldquo;Did you lock
      the door after you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, bolted it,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;That is well.&rdquo; Neither of
      them said. &ldquo;Who do you think it is?&rdquo; But each knew what the other thought.
      They returned through the ante-chamber to the dressing-room. But when they
      opened the door, all was quiet&mdash;no one behind the curtain, no one in
      the room&mdash;they searched under the sofas, everywhere; there was no
      closet or hiding-place in which any one could be concealed. The window
      fastenings were unstirred. But the door into the gallery was unlocked, and
      the simple thing appeared&mdash;that Helen, in her confusion, had thought
      only of fastening the door into the ante-chamber, which also opened on the
      gallery, but had totally forgotten to lock that from the dressing-room
      into the gallery, by which whoever had been in the room had escaped
      without any difficulty. Lady Davenant rather inclined to believe that no
      one had been there, and that it was all Helen&rsquo;s imagination. But Helen
      persisted that she had seen what she had seen, and heard what she had
      heard. They went into the gallery&mdash;all silence, no creature visible,
      and the doors at the ends of the gallery locked outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a fruitless search they retired, Lady Davenant to her own room, and
      Helen to hers, full of shame and regret that she had not had the courage
      to open the curtain at the right moment. Nothing could stir her belief,
      however, in the evidence of her senses; the boy must have been there, and
      must be still concealed somewhere in the gallery, or in some of the rooms
      opening into it. Some of these were unoccupied, but they were all locked
      up, as Lady Davenant had told her when she had proposed searching them;
      one or two they tried and found fastened. She stood at her own door, after
      having put down the candle on her table, still giving a lingering
      look-out, when, through the darkness in the gallery at the further end,
      she saw a ray of light on the floor, which seemed to come from under the
      door of a room unoccupied&mdash;Mr. Mapletofft&rsquo;s room; he had gone to town
      with Lord Davenant. Helen went on tiptoe very softly along the gallery,
      almost to this door, when it suddenly opened, and the page stood before
      her, the lamp in his hand shining full on his face and on hers. Both
      started&mdash;then both were motionless for one second&mdash;but he,
      recovering instantly, shot back again into the room, flung to the door,
      and locked it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seen him!&rdquo; cried Lady Davenant, when Helen flew to her room and told her;
      &ldquo;seen him! do you say?&rdquo; and then ringing her bell, she bade Helen run and
      knock at the general&rsquo;s door, while she went herself to Mr. Mapletofft&rsquo;s
      room, commanding Carlos to open the door immediately. But he would not
      open it, nor make any answer; the servants came, and the general ordered
      one to go round to the windows of the room lest the boy should escape that
      way. It was too late, he had escaped; when the door was forced, one of the
      windows was found open; Carlos was not in the room; he must have swung
      himself down from the height by means of a tree which was near the window.
      The lamp was still burning, and papers half burnt smouldering on the
      table. There were sufficient remains to tell what they had been. Lady
      Davenant saw, in the handwriting of Carlos, copies of letters taken from
      her desk. One half unburnt cover of the packet he had been making up,
      showed by its direction to whom it was to have been sent, and there were a
      few lines in the boy&rsquo;s own writing within&mdash;side-addressed to his
      employer, which revealed the whole. His employer was, as Lady Davenant had
      suspected&mdash;the diplomatist!
    </p>
    <p>
      A duplicate Bramah key was found under the table, and she recollected that
      she had some months ago missed this duplicate key of her desk, and
      supposed she had dropped it from her watch-ring while out walking; she
      recollected, further, that Carlos had with great zeal assisted her in the
      search for it all through the shrubbery walks. The proofs of this boy&rsquo;s
      artifice and long-premeditated treachery, accumulating upon Lady Davenant,
      shocked her so much that she could not think of anything else. &ldquo;Is it
      possible? is it in human nature?&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Such falsehood, such
      art, such ingratitude!&rdquo; As she fixed her eyes upon the writing, scarcely
      yet dry, she repeated. &ldquo;It <i>is</i> his writing&mdash;I see it, yet can
      scarcely believe it! I, who taught him to write myself&mdash;guided that
      little hand to make the first letters that he ever formed! And this is in
      human nature! I could not have conceived it&mdash;it is dreadful to be so
      convinced, it lowers one&rsquo;s confidence in one&rsquo;s fellow-creatures. That is
      the worst of all!&rdquo; She sighed deeply, and then, turning to Helen, said,
      &ldquo;But let us think no more of it to-night, we can do no more, they are in
      pursuit of him; I hope I may never, never, see him more.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Some people value their friends most for active service, some for passive
      kindness. Some are won by tender expressions, some convinced by solid
      proofs of regard; others of a yet nobler kind, and of this sort was Lady
      Davenant, are apt to be best pleased, most touched, by proofs that their
      own character has been thoroughly understood, and that they have justly
      appreciated the good qualities of their friend. More than by all the
      kindness and sympathy Helen had ever before shown her was she now pleased
      and touched by the respect for her feelings in this affair of the page.
      Helen never having at the moment of his detection nor afterwards, by word
      or look, indulged in the self-triumph of &ldquo;You see how right I was!&rdquo; which
      implies, &ldquo;You see how wrong you were!&rdquo; On the contrary, she gave what
      comfort she honestly could by showing that she knew from what humane
      motives and generous feelings Lady Davenant had persisted in supporting
      this boy to the last.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the little wretch himself, he appeared no more. Search was made for
      him in every direction, but he was not to be found, and Helen thought it
      was well that Lady Davenant should be spared the pain of seeing or hearing
      more about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole mystery was now solved, the difficulty for Lady Davenant in a
      fair way to be ended. She had felt an instinctive aversion to the fawning
      tone of the diplomatist, whom she had suspected of caballing against Lord
      Davenant secretly, and it was now proved that he had been base beyond what
      she could have conceived possible; had been in confederacy with this boy,
      whom he had corrupted, purchasing from him copies of private letters, and
      bribing him to betray his benefactress. The copy of that letter from an
      illustrious personage had been thus obtained. The proofs now brought home
      to the guilty person, deprived him at once of all future means of injuring
      Lord Davenant. Completely in their power, he would be ready to ensure
      silence at any price, and, instead of caballing further, this low
      intriguer would now be compelled to return from whence he came, too happy
      to be permitted to retreat from his situation, and quit England without
      being brought to public disgrace. No notice of the report that had been in
      private circulation against Lady Davenant having yet appeared in the
      public prints, it was possible to prevent the mischief that even the
      mention of her name in such an affair must have occasioned. It was
      necessary, however, that letters should be written immediately to the
      different persons whom the private reports had reached; and Helen and her
      daughter trembled for her health in consequence of this extreme hurry and
      fatigue, but she repeated her favourite maxim&mdash;&ldquo;Better to wear out,
      than to rust out&rdquo;&mdash;and she accomplished all that was to be done. Lord
      Davenant wrote in triumph that all was settled, all difficulties removed,
      and they were to set out for Russia immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now Lady Davenant breathed freely. Relieved from the intolerable
      thought that the base finger of suspicion could point at her or at Lord
      Davenant, her spirits rose, her whole appearance renovated, and all the
      fears that Helen and her daughter had felt, lest she should not be able to
      sustain the hardships of a long voyage and the rigour of a northern
      climate, were now completely dispelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day of departure was fixed&mdash;Lady Davenant remained, however, as
      long as she possibly could with her daughter; and she was anxious, too, to
      see Granville Beauclerc before she left Clarendon Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      The number of the days of quarantine were gone over every morning at
      breakfast by Lady Cecilia and the general; they looked in the papers
      carefully for the arrivals at the hotel which Beauclerc usually
      frequented. This morning, in reading the list aloud, the general came to
      the name of Sir Thomas D&rsquo;Aubigny, brother to the colonel. The paragraph
      stated that Colonel D&rsquo;Aubigny had left some manuscripts to his brother,
      which would soon be published, and then followed some puff in the usual
      style, which the general did not think it necessary to read. But one of
      the officers, who knew some of the D&rsquo;Aubignys, went on talking of the
      colonel, and relating various anecdotes to prove that his souvenirs would
      be amusing. Helen, who was conscious that she always blushed when Colonel
      D&rsquo;Aubigny&rsquo;s name was mentioned, and that the general had observed it, was
      glad that he never looked up from what he was reading, and when she had
      courage to turn towards her, she admired Cecilia&rsquo;s perfect
      self-possession. Beauclerc&rsquo;s name was not among the arrivals, and it was
      settled consequently that they should not see him this day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time after they had left the breakfast-room, Helen found Lady
      Davenant in her own apartment, sitting, as it was very unusual with her,
      perfectly unemployed&mdash;her head leaning on her hand, and an expression
      of pain in her countenance. &ldquo;Are not you well, my dear Lady Davenant?&rdquo;
       Helen asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mind is not well,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;and that always affects my body, and
      I suppose my looks.&rdquo; After a moment&rsquo;s silence she fixed her eyes on Helen,
      and said, &ldquo;You tell me that Colonel D&rsquo;Aubigny never was a lover&mdash;never
      was an admirer of yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; said Helen, low, but very decidedly. Lady Davenant sighed, but
      did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a longer continuance of silence than had almost ever occurred when
      they two were alone together, Lady Davenant looked up, and said, &ldquo;I hope
      in God that I am mistaken. I pray that I may never live to see it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To see what?&rdquo; cried Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To see that one little black spot, invisible to you, Helen, the speck of
      evil in that heart&mdash;my daughter&rsquo;s heart&mdash;spread and taint, and
      destroy all that is good. It must be cut out&mdash;at any pain it must be
      cut away; if any part be unsound, the corruption will spread.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Corruption in Cecilia!&rdquo; exclaimed Helen. &ldquo;Oh! I know her&mdash;I know her
      from dear childhood! there is nothing corrupt in her, no, not a thought!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Helen, you see her as she has been&mdash;as she is. I see her as
      she may become&mdash;very&mdash;frightfully different. Helen! if truth
      fail, if the principle of truth fail in her character, all will fail! All
      that charming nature, all that fair semblance, all that fair reality, all
      this bright summer&rsquo;s dream of happiness, even love&mdash;the supreme
      felicity of her warm heart&mdash;even love will fail her. Cecilia will
      lose her husband&rsquo;s affections!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen uttered a faint cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse!&rdquo; continued Lady Davenant. &ldquo;Worse! she will lose her own esteem,
      she will sink, but I shall be gone,&rdquo; cried she, and pressing her hand upon
      her heart, she faintly repeated, &ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; And then abruptly added, &ldquo;Call
      Cecilia! I must see Cecilia, I must speak to her. But first I will tell
      you, from a few words that dropped this morning from General Clarendon, I
      suspect&mdash;I fear that Cecilia has deceived him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible!&mdash;about what&mdash;about whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Colonel D&rsquo;Aubigny,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know all about it, and it was all nothing but nonsense. Did you look at
      her when the general read that paragraph this morning&mdash;did you see
      that innocent countenance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw it, Helen, and thought as you did, but I have been so deceived&mdash;so
      lately in countenance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not by hers&mdash;never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not by yours, Helen, never. And yet, why should I say so? This very
      morning, yours, had I not known you, yours would have misled me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my foolish absurd habit of blushing, how I wish I could prevent it!&rdquo;
       said Helen; &ldquo;I know it will make me betray somebody some time or other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betray! What have you to betray?&rdquo; cried Lady Davenant, leaning forward
      with an eagerness of eye and voice that startled Helen from all power of
      immediate reply. After an instant&rsquo;s pause, however, she answered firmly,
      &ldquo;Nothing, Lady Davenant, and that there is nothing wrong to be known about
      Cecilia, I as firmly believe as that I stand here at this moment. Can you
      suspect anything really wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suspect!&mdash;wrong!&rdquo; cried Lady Davenant, starting up, with a look in
      her eyes which made Helen recoil. &ldquo;Helen, what can you conceive that I
      suspect wrong?&mdash;Cecilia?&mdash;Captain D&rsquo;Aubigny?&mdash;What did you
      mean? Wrong did you say?&mdash;of Cecilia? Could you mean&mdash;could you
      conceive, Helen, that I, having such a suspicion could be here&mdash;living
      with her&mdash;or&mdash;living anywhere&mdash;&rdquo; And she sank down on the
      sofa again, seized with sudden spasm&mdash;in a convulsion of agonising
      pain. But she held Helen&rsquo;s hand fast grasped, detaining her&mdash;preventing
      her from pulling the bell; and by degrees the pain passed off, the livid
      hue cleared away, the colour of life once more returned, but more tardily
      than before, and Helen was excessively alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor child! my poor, dear child, I feel&mdash;I hear your heart beating.
      You are a coward, Helen, but a sweet creature; and I love you&mdash;and I
      love my daughter. What were we saying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, say no more! say no more now, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; said Helen,
      kneeling beside her; and, yielding to that imploring look, Lady Davenant,
      with a fond smile, parted the hair on her forehead, kissed her, and
      remained perfectly quiet and silent for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite well again now,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and quite composed. If Cecilia has
      told her husband the whole truth, she will continue to be, as she is, a
      happy wife; but if she have deceived him in the estimation of a single
      word&mdash;she is undone. With him, of all men, never will confidence,
      once broken, unite again. Now General Clarendon told me this morning&mdash;would
      I had known it before the marriage!&mdash;that he had made one point with
      my daughter, and only one, on the faith of which he married: the point
      was, that she should tell him, if she had ever loved any other man. And
      she told him&mdash;I fear from some words which he said afterwards&mdash;I
      am sure he is in the belief&mdash;the certainty, that his wife never loved
      any man breathing but himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor did she,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;I can answer for it&mdash;she has told him the
      truth&mdash;and she has nothing to fear, nor have you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You give me new life!&rdquo; cried Lady Davenant, her face becoming suddenly
      radiant with hope; &ldquo;but how can you answer for this, Helen? You had no
      part in any deceit, I am sure, but there was something about a miniature
      of you, which I found in Colonel D&rsquo;Aubigny&rsquo;s hands one day. That was done,
      I thought at the time, to deceive me, to make me believe that you were his
      object.&mdash;Deceit there was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On his part,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;much and always; but on Cecilia&rsquo;s there was
      only, from her over-awe of you, some little concealment; but the whole was
      broken off and repented of, whatever little there was, long since. And as
      to loving him, she never did; she told me so then, and often and often she
      has told me so since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Convince me of that,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant; &ldquo;convince me that she thought
      what she said. I believe, indeed, that till she met General Clarendon she
      never felt any enthusiastic attachment, but I thought she liked that man&mdash;it
      was all coquetry, flirting nonsense perhaps. Be it so&mdash;I am willing
      to believe it. Convince me but that she is true&mdash;there is the only
      point of consequence. The man is dead and gone, the whole in oblivion, and
      all that is of importance is her truth; convince me but of that, and I am
      a happy mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen brought recollections, and proofs from conversations at the time and
      letters since, confirming at least Cecilia&rsquo;s own belief that she had never
      loved the man, that it was all vanity on her part and deception on his:
      Lady Davenant listened, willing to be convinced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;let us put this matter out of our minds entirely&mdash;I
      want to talk to you of yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took Helen out with her in her pony-phaeton, and spoke of Granville
      Beauclerc, and of his and Helen&rsquo;s prospects of happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia, who was riding with her husband in some fields adjoining the
      park, caught a glimpse of the phaeton as it went along the avenue, and,
      while the general was giving some orders to the wood-ranger about a new
      plantation, she, telling him that she would be back in two minutes,
      cantered off to overtake her mother, and, making a short cut across the
      fields, she leaped a wide ha-ha which came in her way. She was an
      excellent horse-woman, and Fairy carried her lightly over; and when she
      heard the general&rsquo;s voice in dismay and indignation at what she had done,
      she turned and laughed, and cantered on till she overtook the phaeton. The
      breeze had blown her hair most becomingly, and raised her colour, and her
      eyes were joyously bright, and her light figure, always well on horseback,
      now looked so graceful as she bent to speak to her mother, that her
      husband could not find it in his heart to scold her, and he who came to
      chide remained to admire. Her mother, looking up at her, could not help
      exclaiming,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! certainly, you are an excessively pretty creature!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bearers of good news always look well, I believe,&rdquo; said she, smiling; &ldquo;so
      there is now some goodness in my face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That there certainly is,&rdquo; said her mother, fondly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you certainly don&rsquo;t know what it is&mdash;you cannot know till I tell
      you, my dearest Helen&mdash;my dear mother, I mean. Granville Beauclerc
      will be here to-day&mdash;I am sure of it. So pray do not go far from home&mdash;do
      not go out of the grounds: this was what I was in such a hurry to say to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how do you know, Cecilia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just because I can read,&rdquo; replied she, &ldquo;because I can read a newspaper
      through, which none of you newspaper-readers by profession could do this
      morning. After you all of you laid them down I took them up, and found in
      that evening paper which your stupid aide-de-camp had been poring and
      boring over, a fresh list of arrivals, and Mr. Granville Beauclerc among
      them at full length. Now he would not stay a moment longer in town than
      was absolutely necessary, you know, or else he ought to be excommunicated.
      But it is not in his nature to delay; he will be here directly&mdash;I
      should not be surprised&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, Cecilia,&rdquo; interrupted the general. &ldquo;I see a caleche on
      that road.&mdash;It is he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The caleche turned into the park, and in a few minutes they met.&mdash;Carriages,
      horses, and servants, were sent off to the house, while the whole party
      walked, and talked, and looked. Lady Cecilia was in delightful spirits,
      and so affectionately, so delicately joyful&mdash;so kind, that if Helen
      and Beauclerc had ever blamed, or had reason to blame her, it must now be
      for ever forgotten. As, in their walk, they came near that seat by the
      water&rsquo;s side where the lovers had parted, Cecilia whispered something to
      her mother, and instantly it was &ldquo;done as desired.&rdquo; Beauclerc and Helen
      were left to their own explanations, and the rest of the party pursued
      their walk home. Of what passed in this explanatory scene no note has been
      transmitted to the biographer, and we must be satisfied with the result.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All is right!&rdquo; cried Lady Cecilia. &ldquo;O my dear mother, I am the happiest
      creature in the world, if you were not going away; could not you stay&mdash;a
      little, a very little longer&mdash;just till&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, my dear, do not urge me to stay,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant; &ldquo;I cannot&mdash;your
      father expects me to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All her preparations were made&mdash;in short, it must be so, and Lady
      Davenant begged her daughter would not spend the short remaining time they
      were to have together in entreaties, distressing and irritating to the
      feelings of those who ask and of those who must refuse. &ldquo;Let us enjoy in
      peace,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;all that is to be enjoyed this day before I go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Helen entered the drawing-room before dinner, knowing that she was
      very late, she found assembled Lady Davenant, Beauclerc, and the officers,
      but Cecilia was not there, nor did the punctual general make his
      appearance; the dinner-hour was passed, a servant had twice looked in to
      announce it, and, seeing neither my lady nor the general, had in surprise
      retired. Silence prevailed&mdash;what could be the matter? So unusual for
      the general to be late. The general came in, hurried&mdash;very uncommon
      in him, and, after saying a few words in a low voice to Lady Davenant, who
      immediately went up stairs, he begged pardon, was very sorry he had kept
      dinner waiting, but Lady Cecilia had been taken ill&mdash;had fainted&mdash;she
      was better&mdash;he hoped it was nothing that would signify&mdash;she was
      lying down&mdash;he begged they would go to dinner. And to dinner they
      went, and when Lady Davenant returned she put Helen&rsquo;s mind at ease by
      saying it was only a little faintishness from over-fatigue. She had
      prescribed rest, and Cecilia had herself desired to be left quite alone.
      After dinner Lady Davenant went up again to see her, found her not so well&mdash;feverish;
      she would not let Helen go to her&mdash;they would talk if they were
      together, and she thought it necessary to keep Cecilia very quiet. If she
      would but submit to this, she would be well again probably in the morning.
      At tea-time, and in the course of the evening twice, Cecilia sent to beg
      to speak to Helen; but Lady Davenant and the general joined in requesting
      her not to go. The general went himself to Lady Cecilia to enforce
      obedience, and he reported that she had submitted with a good grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen was happily engaged by Beauclerc&rsquo;s conversation during the rest of
      the evening. It was late before they retired, and when she went up-stairs,
      Felicie said that her lady was asleep, and had been asleep for the last
      two hours, and she was sure that after such good rest her ladyship would
      be perfectly well in the morning. Without further anxiety about her
      friend, therefore, Helen went to her own room. It was a fine moonlight
      night, and she threw open the shutters, and stood for a long time looking
      out upon the moonlight, which she loved; and even after she had retired to
      bed it was long before she could sleep. The only painful thought in her
      mind was of Lady Davenant&rsquo;s approaching departure; without her, all
      happiness would be incomplete; but still, hope and love had much that was
      delightful to whisper, and, as she at last sank to sleep, Beauclerc&rsquo;s
      voice seemed still speaking to her in soft sounds. Yet the dream which
      followed was uneasy; she thought that they were standing together in the
      library, at the open door of the conservatory, by moonlight, and he asked
      her to walk out, and when she did not comply, all changed, and she saw him
      walking with another&mdash;with Lady Castlefort; but then the figure
      changed to one younger&mdash;more beautiful&mdash;it must be, as the
      beating of Helen&rsquo;s heart in the dream told her&mdash;it must be Lady
      Blanche. Without seeing Helen, however, they seemed to come on, smiling
      and talking low to each other along the matted alley of the conservatory,
      almost to the very door where she was still, as she thought, standing with
      her hand upon the lock, and then they stopped, and Beauclerc pulled from
      an orange-tree a blossom which seemed the very same which Helen had given
      to him that evening, he offered it to Lady Blanche, and something he
      whispered; but at this moment the handle of the lock seemed to slip, and
      Helen awoke with a start; and when she was awake, the noise of her dream
      seemed to continue; she heard the real sound of a lock turning&mdash;her
      door slowly opened, and a white figure appeared. Helen started up in her
      bed, and awaking thoroughly, saw that it was only Cecilia in her
      dressing-gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cecilia! What&rsquo;s the matter, my dear? are you worse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia put her finger on her lips, closed the door behind her, and
      said, &ldquo;Hush! hush! or you&rsquo;ll waken Felicie; she is sleeping in the
      dressing-room to-night. Mamma ordered it, in case I should want her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how are you now? What can I do for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Helen, you can do something for me indeed. But don&rsquo;t get up. Lie
      down and listen to me. I want to speak to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, then, my dear Cecilia, sit down here beside me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, I need not sit down, I am very well, standing. Only let me say
      what I have to say. I am quite well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite well! indeed you are not. I feel you all trembling. You must sit
      down, indeed, my dear,&rdquo; said Helen, pressing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down. &ldquo;Now listen to me&mdash;do not waste time, for I can&rsquo;t stay.
      Oh! if the general should awake and find me gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter, my dear Cecilia? Only tell me what I can do for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the thing; but I am afraid, now it is come to the point.&rdquo; Lady
      Cecilia breathed quick and short. &ldquo;I am almost afraid to ask you to do
      this for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid! my dear Cecilia, to ask me to do anything in this world for you!
      How can you be afraid? Tell me only what it is at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very foolish&mdash;I am very weak. I know you love me&mdash;would do
      anything for me, Helen. And this is the simplest thing in the world, but
      the greatest favour&mdash;the greatest service. It is only just to receive
      a packet, which the general will give you in the morning. He will ask if
      it is for you. And you will just accept of it. I don&rsquo;t ask you to say it
      is yours, or to say a word about it&mdash;only receive it for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I will, to be sure. But why should he give it to me, and not to
      yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he thinks, and you must let him think, it is for you, that&rsquo;s all.
      Will you promise me?&rdquo;&mdash;But Helen made no answer. &ldquo;Oh, promise me,
      promise me, speak, for I can&rsquo;t stay. I will explain it all to you in the
      morning.&rdquo; She rose to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay, stay! Cecilia,&rdquo; cried Helen, stopping her; &ldquo;stay!&mdash;you must,
      indeed, explain it all to me now&mdash;you must indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia hesitated&mdash;said she had not time. &ldquo;You said, Helen, that
      you would take the packet, and you know you must; but I will explain it
      all as fast as I can. You know I fainted, but you do not know why? I will
      tell you exactly how it all happened:&mdash;you recollect my coming into
      the library after I was dressed, before you went up-stairs, and giving you
      a sprig of orange flowers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, I was dreaming of it just now when you came in,&rdquo; said Helen.
      &ldquo;Well, what of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, only you must have been surprised to hear so soon afterwards
      that I had fainted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Helen said, she had been very much surprised and alarmed; and again
      Lady Cecilia paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I went from you directly to Clarendon, to give him a rose, which
      you may remember I had in my hand for him. I found him in the study,
      talking to corporal somebody. He just smiled as I came in, took the rose,
      and said, &lsquo;I shall be ready this moment:&rsquo; and looking to a table on which
      were heaps of letters and parcels which Granville had brought from town,
      he added, &lsquo;I do not know whether there is anything there for you,
      Cecilia?&rsquo; I went to look, and he went on talking to his corporal. He was
      standing with his back to the table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen felt that Lady Cecilia told all these minute details as if there was
      some fact to which she feared to come. Cecilia went on very quickly. &ldquo;I
      did not find anything for myself; but in tossing over the papers I saw a
      packet directed to General Clarendon. I thought it was a feigned hand&mdash;and
      yet that I knew it&mdash;that I had seen it somewhere lately. There was
      one little flourish that I recollected; it was like the writing of that
      wretched Carlos.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carlos!&rdquo; cried Helen: &ldquo;well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The more I looked at it,&rdquo; continued Lady Cecilia, &ldquo;the more like I
      thought it; and I was going to say so to the general, only I waited till
      he had done his business: but as I was examining it through the outer
      cover, of very thin foreign paper, I could distinguish the writing of some
      of the inside, and it was like your hand or like mine. You know, between
      our hands there is such a great resemblance, there is no telling one from
      the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen did not think so, but she remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least,&rdquo; said Cecilia, answering her look of doubt, &ldquo;at least the
      general says so; he never knows our hands asunder. Well! I perceived that
      there was something hard inside&mdash;more than papers; and as I felt it,
      there came from it an uncommon perfume&mdash;a particular perfume, like
      what I used to have once, at the time&mdash;that time that I can never
      bear to think of, you know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Helen, and in a low voice she added, &ldquo;you mean about
      Colonel D&rsquo;Aubigny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The perfume, and altogether I do not know what, quite overcame me. I had
      just sense enough to throw the packet from me: I made an effort, and
      reached the window, and I was trying to open the sash, I remember; but
      what happened immediately after that, I cannot tell you. When I came to
      myself, I was in my husband&rsquo;s arms; he was carrying me up-stairs&mdash;and
      so much alarmed about me he was! Oh, Helen, I do so love him! He laid me
      on the bed, and he spoke so kindly, reproaching me for not taking more
      care of myself&mdash;but so fondly! Somehow I could not bear it just then,
      and I closed my eyes as his met mine. He, I knew, could suspect nothing&mdash;but
      still! He stayed beside me, holding my hand: then dinner was ready; he had
      been twice summoned. It was a relief to me when he left me. Next, I
      believe, my mother came up, and felt my pulse, and scolded me for
      over-fatiguing myself, and for that leap; and I pleaded guilty, and it was
      all very well. I saw she had not an idea there was anything else. Mamma
      really is not suspicious, with all her penetration&mdash;she is not
      suspicious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why did you not tell her all the little you had to tell, dear
      Cecilia? If you had, long ago, when I begged of you to do so&mdash;if you
      had told your mother all about&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Told her!&rdquo; interrupted Cecilia; &ldquo;told my mother!&mdash;oh no, Helen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen sighed, and feebly said, &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! when you were at dinner, it came into my poor head that the general
      would open that parcel before I could see you again, and before I could
      ask your advice and settle with you&mdash;before I could know what was to
      be done. I was so anxious, I sent for you twice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Lady Davenant and the general forbade me to go to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;&mdash;Lady Cecilia said she understood that, and she had seen the
      danger of showing too much impatience to speak to Helen; she thought it
      might excite suspicion of her having something particular to say, she had
      therefore refrained from asking again. She was not asleep when Helen came
      to bed, though Felicie thought she was; she was much too anxious to sleep
      till she had seen her husband again; she was awake when he came into his
      room; she saw him come in with some letters and packets in his hand; by
      his look she knew all was still safe&mdash;he had not opened <i>that</i>
      particular packet&mdash;he held it among a parcel of military returns in
      his hand as he came to the side of the bed on tiptoe to see if she was
      asleep&mdash;to ask how she did; &ldquo;He touched my pulse,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia,&mdash;&ldquo;and
      I am sure he might well say it was terribly quick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every instant I thought he would open that packet. He threw it, however,
      and all the rest, down on the table, to be read in the morning, as usual,
      as soon as he awoke. After feeling my pulse again, the last thing, and
      satisfying himself that it was better&mdash;&lsquo;Quieter now,&rsquo; said he, he
      fell fast asleep, and slept so soundly, and I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen looked at her with astonishment, and was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh speak to me!&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia, &ldquo;what do you say, Helen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say that I cannot imagine why you are so much alarmed about this
      packet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I am a fool, I believe,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia, trying to laugh. &ldquo;I
      am so afraid of his opening it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why?&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;what do you think there is in it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told you, surely! Letters&mdash;foolish letters of mine to that
      D&rsquo;Aubigny. Oh how I repent I ever wrote a line to him! And he told me, he
      absolutely swore, he had destroyed every note and letter I ever wrote to
      him. He was the most false of human beings!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a very bad man&mdash;I always thought so,&rdquo; said Helen; &ldquo;but,
      Cecilia, I never knew that he had any letters of yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, you did, my dear, at the time; do not you recollect I showed you
      a letter, and it was you who made me break off the correspondence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember your showing me several letters of his,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;but not
      of yours&mdash;only one or two notes&mdash;asking for that picture back
      again which he had stolen from your portfolio.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and about the verses; surely you recollect my showing you another
      letter of mine, Helen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but these were all of no consequence; there must be more, or you
      could not be so much afraid, Cecilia, of the general&rsquo;s seeing these,
      surely.&rdquo; At this moment Lady Davenant&rsquo;s prophecy, all she had said about
      her daughter, flashed across Helen&rsquo;s mind, and with increasing eagerness
      she went on. &ldquo;What is there in those letters that can alarm you so much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I declare I do not know,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;that is the plain truth; I
      cannot recollect&mdash;I cannot be certain what there is in them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is not so long ago, Cecilia,&mdash;only two years?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true, but so many great events have happened since, and such new
      feelings, all that early nonsense was swept out of my mind. I never really
      loved that wretch&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A gleam of joy came across Helen&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, never,&rdquo; repeated Lady Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am happy still,&rdquo; cried Helen. &ldquo;I told your mother I was sure of
      this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens!&mdash;Does she know about this packet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&mdash;how could she? But what frightens you, my dear Cecilia? you
      say there is nothing wrong in the letters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing&mdash;nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then make no wrong out of nothing,&rdquo; cried Helen. &ldquo;If you break confidence
      with your husband, that confidence will never, never unite again&mdash;your
      mother says so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother!&rdquo; cried Cecilia: &ldquo;Good heavens!&mdash;so she does suspect?&mdash;tell
      me, Helen, tell me what she suspects.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you did not at first&mdash;before you were married, tell the general
      the whole truth about Colonel D&rsquo;Aubigny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is not yet too late,&rdquo; said Helen, earnestly; &ldquo;you can set it all
      right now&mdash;this is the moment, my dearest Cecilia. Do, do,&rdquo; cried
      Helen, &ldquo;do tell him all&mdash;bid him look at the letters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at them! Impossible! Impossible!&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia. &ldquo;Bid me die
      rather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned quite away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, Cecilia;&rdquo; she held her fast. &ldquo;You must do it, Cecilia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen, I cannot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can, indeed you can,&rdquo; said Helen; &ldquo;only have courage <i>now</i>, and
      you will be happier all your life afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not ask it&mdash;do not ask it&mdash;it is all in vain, you are
      wasting time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no&mdash;not wasting time; and in short, Cecilia, you must do what I
      ask of you, for it is right; and I will not do what you ask of me, for it
      is wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not!&mdash;You will not!&rdquo; cried Lady Cecilia, breathless. &ldquo;After
      all! You will not receive the packet for me! you will not let the general
      believe the letters to be yours! Then I am undone! You will not do it!&mdash;Then
      do not talk to me&mdash;do not talk to me&mdash;you do not know General
      Clarendon. If his jealousy were once roused, you have no idea what it
      would be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the man were alive,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;but since he is dead&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Clarendon would never forgive me for having loved another&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said you did not love him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor did I ever <i>really</i> love that man; but still Clarendon, from
      even seeing those letters, might think I did. The very fact of having
      written such letters would be destruction to me with Clarendon. You do not
      know Clarendon. How can I convince you it is impossible for me to tell
      him? At the time he first proposed for me&mdash;oh! how I loved him, and
      feared to lose him. One day my mother, when I was not by, said something&mdash;I
      do not know what, about a first love, let fall something about that
      hateful D&rsquo;Aubigny, and the general came to me in such a state! Oh, Helen,
      in such a state! I thought it was all at an end. He told me he never would
      marry any woman on earth who had ever loved another. I told him I never
      had, and that was true, you know; but then I went a little beyond perhaps.
      I said I had never THOUGHT of anybody else, for he made such a point of
      that. In short, I was a coward&mdash;a fool; I little foresaw&mdash;I
      laughed it off, and told him that what mamma had said was all a mistake,
      all nonsense; that Colonel D&rsquo;Aubigny was a sort of universal flirt&mdash;and
      that was very true, I am sure: that he had admired us both, both you and
      me, but you last, you most, Helen, I said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Cecilia, how could you say so, when you knew he never cared for me in
      the least?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, my dear, for there was no other way; and what harm did it do
      you, or what harm can it ever do you? It only makes it the easier for you
      to help me&mdash;to save me now. And Granville,&rdquo; continued Lady Cecilia,
      thinking that was the obstacle in Helen&rsquo;s mind, &ldquo;and Granville need never
      know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen&rsquo;s countenance suddenly changed&mdash;&ldquo;Granville! I never thought of
      that!&rdquo; and now that she did think of it, she reproached herself with the
      selfishness of that fear. Till this moment, she knew her motives had been
      all singly for Cecilia&rsquo;s happiness; now the fear she felt of this some way
      hurting her with Beauclerc made her less resolute. Lady Cecilia saw her
      giving way and hurried on&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear Helen! I know I have been very wrong, but you would not quite
      give me up, would you?&mdash;Oh! for my mother&rsquo;s sake! Consider how it
      would be with my mother, so ill as you saw her! I am sure if anything
      broke out now in my mother&rsquo;s state of health it would be fatal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen became excessively agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Helen! would you make me the death of that mother?&mdash;Oh, Helen,
      save her! and do what you will with me afterwards. It will be only for a
      few hours&mdash;only a few hours!&rdquo; repeated Lady Cecilia, seeing that
      these words made a great impression upon Helen,&mdash;&ldquo;Save me, Helen!
      save my mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sank upon her knees, clasping her hands in an agony of supplication.
      Helen bent down her head and was silent&mdash;she could no longer refuse.
      &ldquo;Then I must,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh thank you! bless you!&rdquo; cried Lady Cecilia in an ecstasy&mdash;&ldquo;you
      will take the letters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Helen feebly said; &ldquo;yes, since it must be so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia embraced her, thanked her, blessed her, and hastily left the room,
      but in an instant afterward she returned, and said, &ldquo;One thing I forgot,
      and I must tell you. Think of my forgetting it! The letters are not signed
      with my real name, they are signed Emma&mdash;Henry and Emma!&mdash;Oh
      folly, folly! My dear, dear friend! save me but now, and I never will be
      guilty of the least deception again during my whole life; believe me,
      believe me! When once my mother is safely gone I will tell Clarendon all.
      Look at me, dear Helen, look at me and believe me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Helen looked at her, and Helen believed her.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Helen slept no more this night. When alone in the stillness of the long
      hours, she went over and over again all that had passed, what Cecilia had
      said, what she had at first thought and afterwards felt, all the
      persuasions by which she had been wrought upon, and, on the contrary, all
      the reasons by which she ought to be decided; backward and forward her
      mind vibrated, and its painful vacillation could not be stilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What am I going to do? To tell a falsehood! That cannot be right; but in
      the circumstances&mdash;yet this is Cecilia&rsquo;s own way of palliating the
      fault that her mother so fears in her&mdash;that her mother trusted to me
      to guard her against; and now, already, even before Lady Davenant has left
      us, I am going to assist Cecilia in deceiving her husband, and on that
      very dangerous point&mdash;Colonel D&rsquo;Aubigny.&rdquo; Lady Davenant&rsquo;s foreboding
      having already been so far accomplished struck Helen fearfully, and her
      warning voice in the dead silence of that night sounded, and her look was
      upon her, so strongly, that she for an instant hid her head to get rid of
      her image. &ldquo;But what <i>can</i> I do? her own life is at stake! No less a
      motive could move me, but this ought&mdash;must&mdash;shall decide me.
      Yet, if Lady Davenant were to know it!&mdash;and I, in the last hours I
      have to pass with her&mdash;the last I ever may have with her, shall I
      deceive her? But it is not deceit, only prudence&mdash;necessary prudence;
      what a physician would order, what even humanity requires. I am satisfied
      it is quite right, quite, and I will go to sleep that I may be strong, and
      calm, and do it all well in the morning. After all, I have been too
      cowardly; frightening myself about nothing; too scrupulous&mdash;for what
      is it I have promised? only to receive the letters as if they were mine.
      Not to <i>say</i> that they are mine; he will not ask me, Cecilia thinks
      he will not ask me. But how can she tell? if he should, what <i>can</i> I
      do? I must then answer that they are mine. Indeed it is the same thing,
      for I should lead him to believe it as much by my receiving them in
      silence; it will be telling or acting an absolute falsehood, and can that
      ever be right?&rdquo; Back it came to the same point, and in vain her cheek
      settled on the pillow and she thought she could sleep. Then with closed
      eyes she considered how the general would look, and speak, or not speak.
      &ldquo;What will he think of me when he sees the picture&mdash;the letters? for
      he must open the packet. But he will not read them, no, he is too
      honourable. I do not know what is in them. There can be nothing, however,
      but nonsense, Cecilia says; yet even so, love-letters he must know they
      are, and a clandestine correspondence. I heard him once express such
      contempt for any clandestine affair. He, who is so nice, so strict, about
      women&rsquo;s conduct, how I shall sink in his esteem! Well, be it so, that
      concerns only myself; and it is for his own sake too, to save his
      happiness; and Cecilia, my dear Cecilia, oh I can bear it, and it will be
      a pride to me to bear it, for I am grateful; my gratitude shall not be
      only in words; now, when I am put to the trial, I can do something for my
      friends. Yes, and I will, let the consequences be what they may.&rdquo; Yet
      Beauclerc! that thought was at the bottom of her heart; the fear, the
      almost certainty, that some way or other&mdash;every way in which she
      could think of it, it would lead to difficulty with Beauclerc. But this
      fear was mere selfishness, she thought, and to counteract it came all her
      generous, all her grateful, all her long-cherished, romantic love of
      sacrifice&mdash;a belief that she was capable of self-devotion for the
      friends she loved; and upon the strength of this idea she fixed at last.
      Quieted, she soothed herself to repose, and, worn out with reasoning or
      trying to reason in vain, she at last, in spite of the morning light
      dawning upon her through the unclosed shutters, in a soft sort of
      enthusiastic vision fading away, fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      She slept long; when she awoke it was with that indescribable feeling that
      something painful had happened&mdash;that something dreadful was to be
      this day. She recollected, first, that Lady Davenant was to go. Then came
      all that had passed with Cecilia. It was late, she saw that her maid had
      been in the room, but had refrained from awakening her; she rose, and
      dressed as fast as she could. She was to go to Lady Davenant, when her
      bell rang twice. How to appear before one who knew her countenance so
      well, without showing that any thing had happened, was her first
      difficulty. She looked in her glass to see whether there was any
      alteration in her face; none that she could see, but she was no judge.
      &ldquo;How foolish to think so much about it all!&rdquo; She dressed, and between
      times inquired from her maid if she had heard of any change in Lady
      Davenant&rsquo;s intentions of going. Had any counter-orders about the carriage
      been given? None; it was ordered to be at the door by twelve o&rsquo;clock.
      &ldquo;That was well,&rdquo; Helen said to herself. It would all soon be over. Lady
      Davenant would be safe, then she could bear all the rest; next she hoped,
      that any perturbation or extraordinary emotion in herself would not be
      observed in the hurry of departure, or would be thought natural at parting
      with Lady Davenant. &ldquo;So then, I come at every turn to some little deceit,&rdquo;
       thought she, &ldquo;and I must, I must!&rdquo; and she sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a sad thing for you, ma&rsquo;am, Lady Davenant&rsquo;s going away,&rdquo; said her
      maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen sighed again. &ldquo;Very sad indeed.&rdquo; Suddenly a thought darted into her
      mind, that the whole danger might be avoided. A hope came that the general
      might not open the packet before Lady Davenant&rsquo;s departure, in which case
      Cecilia could not expect that she should abide by her promise, as it was
      only conditional. It had been made really on her mother&rsquo;s account; Cecilia
      had said that if once her mother was safe out of the house, she could
      then, and she would the very next day tell the whole to her husband. Helen
      sprang from under the hands of her maid as she was putting up her hair
      behind, and ran to Cecilia&rsquo;s dressing-room, but she was not there. It was
      now her usual time for coming, and Helen left open the door between them,
      that she might go to her before Felicie should be rung for. She waited
      impatiently, but no Cecilia came. The time, to her impatience, seemed
      dreadfully long. But her maid observed, that as her ladyship had not been
      well yesterday, it was no wonder she was later this morning than usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true, but there is somebody coming along the gallery now, see if
      that is Lady Cecilia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am, Mademoiselle Felicie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle Felicie said ditto to Helen&rsquo;s own maid, and, moreover,
      supposed her lady might not have slept well. Just then, one little
      peremptory knock at the door was heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bon Dieu! C&rsquo;est Monsieur le Général!&rdquo; exclaimed Felicie.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was so&mdash;Felicie went to the door and returned with the general&rsquo;s
      compliments to Miss Stanley, and he begged to see her as soon as it might
      suit her convenience in the library, before she went into the
      breakfast-room, and after she should have seen Lady Cecilia, who wished to
      see her immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen found Lady Cecilia in bed, looking as if she had been much agitated,
      two spots of carnation colour high up in her cheeks, a well-known sign in
      her of great emotion. &ldquo;Helen!&rdquo; she cried, starting up the moment Helen
      came in, &ldquo;he has opened the packet, and you see me alive. But I do believe
      I should have died, when it came to the point, but for you&mdash;dearest
      Helen, I should have been, and still but for you I must be, undone&mdash;and
      my mother&mdash;oh! if he had gone to her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has happened, tell me clearly, my dear Cecilia, and quickly, for I
      must go to General Clarendon; he has desired to see me as soon as I can
      after seeing you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, I know,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;but he will allow time, and you had
      better be some time with me, for he thinks I have all to explain to you
      this morning&mdash;and so I have, a great deal to say to you; sit down&mdash;quietly&mdash;Oh
      if you knew how I have been agitated, I am hardly able yet tell anything
      rightly.&rdquo; She threw herself back on the pillows, and drew a long breath,
      as if to relieve the oppression of mind and body. &ldquo;Now I think I can tell
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then do, my dear Cecilia&mdash;all&mdash;pray do! and exactly&mdash;oh,
      Cecilia, tell me all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every word, every look, to the utmost, as far as I can recollect, as if
      you had been present. Give me your hand, Helen, how cool you are&mdash;delightful!
      but how you tremble!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Helen; &ldquo;but how burning hot your hand is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter. If ever I am well or happy again in this world, Helen, I shall
      owe it to you. After I left you I found the general fast asleep, I do not
      believe he had ever awoke&mdash;I lay awake for hours, till past five
      o&rsquo;clock in the morning, I was wide awake&mdash;feverish. But can you
      conceive it? just then, when I was most anxious to be awake, when I knew
      there was but one hour&mdash;not so much, till he would awake and read
      that packet, I felt an irresistible sleepiness come over me; I turned and
      turned, and tried to keep my eyes open, and pulled and pinched my fingers.
      But all would not do, and I fell asleep, dreaming that I was awake, and
      how long I slept I cannot tell you, so deep, so dead asleep I must have
      been; but the instant I did awake, I started up and drew back the curtain,
      and I saw&mdash;oh, Helen! there was Clarendon dressed&mdash;standing with
      his arms folded&mdash;a letter open hanging from his hand. His eyes were
      fixed upon me, waiting, watching for my first look: he saw me glance at
      the letter in his hand, and then at the packet on the table near the bed.
      For an instant neither of us spoke: I could not, nor exclaim even; but
      surprised, terrified, he must have seen I was. As I leaned forward,
      holding by the curtains, he pulled one of them suddenly back, threw open
      the shutters, and the full glare was upon my face. I shut my eyes&mdash;I
      could not help it&mdash;and shrank; but, gathering strength from absolute
      terror of his silence, I spoke: I asked, &lsquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake! Clarendon,
      what is the matter? Why do you look so?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that look of his! still fixed on me&mdash;the same as I once saw
      before we were married&mdash;once, and but once, when he came from my
      mother to me about this man. Well! I put my hands before my eyes; he
      stepped forward, drew them down, and placed the open letter before me, and
      then asked me, in a terrible sort of suppressed voice, &lsquo;Cecilia, whose
      writing is this?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The writing was before my eyes, but I literally could not see it&mdash;it
      was all a sort of maze. He saw I could not read it, and calmly bade me
      &lsquo;Take time&mdash;examine&mdash;is it a forgery?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A forgery!&mdash;that had never crossed my mind, and for an instant I was
      tempted to say it was; but quickly I saw that would not do: there was the
      miniature, and that could not be a forgery. &lsquo;No,&rsquo; I answered, &lsquo;I do not
      think it is a forgery.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What then?&rsquo; said he, so hastily that I could hardly hear; and before I
      could think what to answer, he said, &lsquo;I must see Lady Davenant.&rsquo; He
      stepped towards the bell; I threw myself upon his arm&mdash;&lsquo;Good Heavens!
      do not, Clarendon, if you are not out of your senses.&rsquo; &lsquo;I am not out of my
      senses, Cecilia, I am perfectly calm; answer me, one word only&mdash;is
      this your writing? Oh! my dear Helen, then it was that you saved me.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, forgive me, Helen, I answered, &lsquo;There is a handwriting so like, that
      you never can tell it from mine. Ask me no more, Clarendon,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw a flash of light, as it were, come across his face&mdash;it was
      hope&mdash;but still it was not certainty. I saw this: oh! how quick one
      sees. He pointed to the first words of the letter, held his finger under
      them, and his hand trembled&mdash;think of his hand trembling! &lsquo;Read,&rsquo; he
      said, and I read. How I brought myself to pronounce the words, I cannot
      imagine. I read what, as I hope for mercy, I had no recollection of ever
      having written&mdash;&lsquo;My dear, too dear Henry.&rsquo; &lsquo;Colonel D&rsquo;Aubigny?&rsquo; said
      the general. I answered, &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; He looked astonished at my self-possession&mdash;and
      so was I. For another instant his finger rested, pressing down there under
      the words, and his eyes on my face, as if he would have read into my soul.
      &lsquo;Ask me no more,&rsquo; I repeated, scarcely able to speak; and something I
      said, I believe, about honour and not betraying you. He turned to the
      signature, and, putting his hand down upon it, asked, &lsquo;What name is signed
      to this letter?&rsquo; I answered, I have seen&mdash;I know&mdash;I believe it
      is &lsquo;Emma.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You knew then of this correspondence?&rsquo; was his next question. I
      confessed I did. He said that was wrong, &lsquo;but quite a different affair&rsquo; 
      from having been engaged in it myself, or some such word. His countenance
      cleared; that pale look of the forehead, the fixed purpose of the eye,
      changed. Oh! I could see&mdash;I understood it all with half a glance&mdash;saw
      the natural colour coming back, and tenderness for me returning&mdash;yet
      some doubt lingering still. He stood, and I heard some half-finished
      sentences. He said that you must have been very young at that time; I
      said, &lsquo;Yes, very young:&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;And the man was a most artful man,&rsquo; he
      observed; I said. &lsquo;Yes, very artful.&rsquo; That was true, I am sure. Clarendon
      then recollected that you showed some emotion one day when Colonel
      D&rsquo;Aubigny was first mentioned&mdash;at that time, you know, when we heard
      of his death. I said nothing. The general went on: &lsquo;I could hardly have
      believed all this of Helen Stanley,&rsquo; he said. He questioned no farther:&mdash;and
      oh! Helen, what do you think I did next? but it was the only thing left me
      to put an end to doubts, which, to <i>me</i>, must have been fatal&mdash;forgive
      me, Helen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me what you did,&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cannot you guess?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told him positively that I wrote the letters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not so bad, I never said that downright falsehood&mdash;no, I could
      not; but I did almost as bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray tell me at once, my dear Cecilia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, in the first place, I stretched out my hand for the whole packet of
      letters which lay on the table untouched.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he put them into my hands and said, &lsquo;There is no direction on these
      but to myself, I have not looked at any of them except this, which in
      ignorance I first opened; I have not read one word of any of the others.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Helen; &ldquo;and what did you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said I was not going to read any of the letters, that I was only
      looking for&mdash;now, Helen, you know&mdash;I told you there was
      something hard in the parcel, something more than papers, I was sure what
      it must be&mdash;the miniature&mdash;the miniature of you, which I
      painted, you know, that I might have it when you were gone, and which <i>he</i>
      stole, and pretended before my mother to be admiring as your likeness, but
      he kept it only because it was my painting. I opened the paper in which it
      was folded; Clarendon darted upon it&mdash;&lsquo;It is Helen!&rsquo; and then he
      said. &lsquo;How like! how beautiful! how unworthy of that man!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, oh, Helen, think of what an escape I had next. There was my name&mdash;my
      initials C. D. at the bottom of the picture, as the painter; and that
      horrible man, not content with his initials opposite to mine, had on the
      back written at full length, &lsquo;For Henry D&rsquo;Aubigny.&rsquo;&mdash;Clarendon looked
      at it, and said between his teeth. &lsquo;He is dead.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Thank God!&rsquo; said
      I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he asked me, how I came to paint this picture for that man; I
      answered&mdash;oh how happy then it was for me that I could tell the whole
      truth about that at least!&mdash;I answered that I did not do the picture
      for Colonel D&rsquo;Aubigny; that it never was given to him; that he stole it
      from my portfolio, and that we both did what we could to get it back again
      from him, but could not. And that you even wanted me to tell my mother,
      but of that I was afraid; and Clarendon said, &lsquo;You were wrong there, my
      dear Cecilia.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was so touched when I heard him call me his dear Cecilia again, and in
      his own dear voice, that I burst into tears. That was a great relief to
      me, and I kept saying over and over again, that I was wrong&mdash;very
      wrong indeed! and then he kneeled down beside me, and I so felt his
      tenderness, his confiding love for me&mdash;for me, unworthy as I am.&rdquo; The
      tears streamed from Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s eyes as she spoke&mdash;&ldquo;Quite
      unworthy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, not quite unworthy,&rdquo; said Helen; &ldquo;my poor dear Cecilia, what you
      must have felt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once!&rdquo; continued Cecilia&mdash;&ldquo;once! Helen, as my head was lying on his
      shoulder, my face hid, I felt so much love, so much remorse, and knowing I
      had done nothing really bad, I was tempted to whisper all in his ear. I
      felt I should be so much happier for ever&mdash;ever&mdash;if I could!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh that you had! my dear Cecilia, I would give anything upon earth for
      your sake, that you had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen, I could not&mdash;I could not. It was too late, I should have been
      undone if I had breathed but a word. When he even suspected the truth!
      that look&mdash;that voice was so terrible. To see it&mdash;hear it again!
      I could not&mdash;oh, Helen, it would have been utter ruin&mdash;madness.
      I grant you, my dear Helen, it might have been done at first, before I was
      married; oh would to heaven it had! but it is useless thinking of that
      now. Helen, my whole earthly happiness is in your hands, this is all I
      have to say, may I&mdash;may I depend on you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, depend upon me, my dearest Cecilia,&rdquo; said Helen; &ldquo;now let me
      go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia held her one instant longer, to say that she had asked
      Clarendon to leave it to her to return the letters, &ldquo;to save you the
      embarrassment, my dearest Helen; but he answered he must do this himself,
      and I did not dare to press the matter; but you need not be alarmed, he
      will be all gentleness to you, he said, &lsquo;it is so different.&rsquo; Do not be
      afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid for myself?&rdquo; said Helen; &ldquo;oh no&mdash;rest, dear Cecilia, and let
      me go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go then, go,&rdquo; cried Cecilia; &ldquo;but for you what would become of my mother!&mdash;of
      me!&mdash;you save us all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Believing this, Helen hastened to accomplish her purpose; resolved to go
      through with it, whatever it might cost; her scruples vanished, and she
      felt a sort of triumphant pleasure in the courage of sacrificing herself.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      General Clarendon was sitting in the music-room, within the library, the
      door open, so that he could see Helen the moment she came in, and that
      moment he threw down his book as he rose, and their eyes met: hers fell
      beneath his penetrating glance; he came forward immediately to meet her,
      with the utmost gentleness and kindness in his whole appearance and
      manner, took her hand, and, drawing her arm within his, said, in the most
      encouraging voice, &ldquo;Consider me as your brother, Helen; you know you have
      allowed me so to feel for you, and so, believe me, I do feel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This kindness quite overcame her, and she burst into tears. He hurried her
      across the library, into the inner room, seated her, and when he had
      closed the door, stood beside her, and began, as if he had been to blame,
      to apologise for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have been surprised at my having opened letters which did not
      belong to me, but there was no direction, no indication that could stop
      me. They were simply in a cover directed to me. The purpose of whoever
      sent them must have been to make me read them; the ultimate purpose was, I
      doubt not, to ruin Lady Cecilia Clarendon in my opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or me,&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Miss Stanley, no, that at all events cannot be,&rdquo; said the general.
      &ldquo;Supposing the letters to be acknowledged by you, still it would be quite
      a different affair. But in the first place look at them, they may be
      forgeries. You will tell me if they are forgeries?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he placed the packet in her hands. Scarcely looking at the writing,
      she answered, &ldquo;No, forgeries I am sure they are not.&rdquo; The general looked
      again at the direction of the cover, and observed, &ldquo;This is a feigned
      hand. Whose can it be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen was on the brink of saying that Cecilia had told her it was like the
      writing of Carlos. Now this cover had not, to the general&rsquo;s knowledge,
      been seen by Cecilia, and that one answer might have betrayed all that she
      was to conceal, for he would instantly have asked how and when did Cecilia
      see it, and the cause of her fainting would have been then understood by
      him. Such hazards in every, even the first, least, step in falsehood; such
      hazard in this first moment! But she escaped this peril, and Helen
      answered: &ldquo;It is something like the writing of the page Carlos, but I do
      not think all that direction is his. There seem to be two different hands.
      I do not know, indeed, how it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some time or other it will come out,&rdquo; said the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will keep this cover, it will lead to the direction of that boy, or of
      whoever it was that employed him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To give her further time the general went on looking at the miniature,
      which he held in his hand. &ldquo;This is a beautiful likeness,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and
      not ill painted&mdash;by Cecilia, was not it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen looked at it, and answered, &ldquo;Yes, by Cecilia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad it is safe,&rdquo; said the general, &ldquo;restored&mdash;Cecilia told me
      the history. I know that it was stolen, not given by you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Given!&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;Oh no! stolen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Base!&rdquo; said the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was base,&rdquo; answered Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Clarendon held in his hand, along with the picture, one letter
      separated from the rest, open; he looked at it as if embarrassed, while
      Helen spoke the last words, and he repeated, &ldquo;Base! yes, he certainly was,
      or he would have destroyed these letters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Helen was on the point of saying that Colonel D&rsquo;Aubigny had told
      Cecilia he had done so, but fortunately her agitation, in default of
      presence of mind, kept her silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the first letter I opened,&rdquo; said the general, &ldquo;before I was aware
      that they were not what I should read. I saw only the first words, I
      thought then that I had a right to read them. When these letters met my
      eyes, I conceived them to have been written by my wife. I had a right to
      satisfy myself respecting the nature of the correspondence; that done, I
      looked no farther. I bore my suspense&mdash;I waited till she awoke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So she told me, Cecilia has told me all; but even if she had not, in any
      circumstances who could doubt your honour, General Clarendon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then trust to it, Miss Stanley, for the past, for the future, trust to
      it! You gratify me more than I can express&mdash;you do me justice. I
      wished to return these letters to you with, my own hand,&rdquo; continued he,
      &ldquo;to satisfy myself, in the first place, that there was no mistake. Of that
      your present candour, indeed, the first look of that ingenuous
      countenance, was sufficient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen felt that she blushed all over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me for distressing you, my dear Helen. It was a matter in which a
      man MUST be selfish,<i> must</i> in point of honour, <i>must</i> in point
      of feeling, I owe to your candour not merely relief from what I could not
      endure and live, but relief from suspicion,&mdash;suspicion of the truth
      of one dearer to me than life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen sat as if she had been transfixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I owe to you,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;the happiness of my whole future life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I am happy,&rdquo; cried Helen, &ldquo;happy in this, at all events, whatever
      may become of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had not yet raised her eyes towards the general; she felt as if her
      first look must betray Cecilia; but she now tried to fix her eyes upon him
      as he looked anxiously at her, and she said, &ldquo;thank you, thank you,
      General Clarendon! Oh, thank you for all the kindness you have shown me;
      but I am the more grieved, it makes me more sorry to sink quite in your
      esteem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To sink! You do not: your candour, your truth raises you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! do not say that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; repeated the general, &ldquo;and you may believe me. I am incapable of
      deceiving you&mdash;this is no matter of compliment. Between friend and
      friend I should count a word, a look of falsehood, treason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen&rsquo;s tears stopped, and, without knowing what she did, she began
      hastily to gather up the packet of letters which she had let fall; the
      general assisted her in putting them into her bag, and she closed the
      strings, thanked him, and was rising, when he went on&mdash;&ldquo;I beg your
      indulgence while I say a few words of myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat down again immediately. &ldquo;Oh! as many as you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I may say I am not of a jealous temper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure you are not,&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you,&rdquo; said the general. &ldquo;May I ask on what your opinion is
      founded?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On what has now passed, and on all that I have heard from Lady Davenant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed. &ldquo;You may have heard then, from Lady Davenant, of some
      unfortunate circumstances in my own and in a friend&rsquo;s family which
      happened a short time before my marriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen said she had.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And of the impression these circumstances made on my mind, my consequent
      resolve never to marry a woman who had ever had any previous attachment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen was breathless at hearing all this repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you informed of these particulars?&rdquo; said the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Helen, faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not asking, Miss Stanley, whether you approved of my resolution;
      simply whether you heard of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s well. It was on an understanding between Cecilia and myself on
      this point, that I married. Did you know this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some words,&rdquo; continued the general, &ldquo;once fell from Lady Davenant
      concerning this Colonel D&rsquo;Aubigny which alarmed me. Cecilia satisfied me
      that her mother was mistaken. Cecilia solemnly assured me that she had
      never loved him.&rdquo; The general paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen, conceiving that he waited for and required her opinion, replied,
      &ldquo;So I always thought&mdash;so I often told Lady Davenant.&rdquo; But at this
      moment recollecting the words at the beginning of that letter, &ldquo;My dear,
      too dear Henry,&rdquo; Helen&rsquo;s voice faltered. The general saw her confusion,
      but attributed it to her own consciousness. &ldquo;Had Lady Davenant not been
      mistaken,&rdquo; resumed he, &ldquo;that is to say had there ever been&mdash;as might
      have happened not unnaturally&mdash;had there ever been an attachment; in
      short, had Cecilia ever loved him, and told me so, I am convinced that
      such truth and candour would have satisfied me, would have increased&mdash;as
      I now feel&mdash;increased my esteem. I am at this moment convinced that,
      in spite of my declared resolution, I should in perfect confidence, have
      married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh that Cecilia had but told him!&rdquo; thought Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not, my dear Miss Stanley,&rdquo; continued the general, &ldquo;have thus
      taken up your time talking of myself, had I not an important purpose in
      view. I was desirous to do away in your mind the idea of my great
      strictness&mdash;not on my own account, but on yours, I wished to dispel
      this notion. Now you will no longer, I trust, apprehend that my esteem for
      you is diminished. I assure you I can make allowances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was shocked at the idea of allowances, yet thanked him for his
      indulgence, and she could hardly refrain from again bursting into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still by your agitation I see you are afraid of me,&rdquo; said he, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No indeed; not afraid of you, but shocked at what you must think of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not surprised, but sorry to see that the alarm I gave my poor
      Cecilia this morning has passed from her mind into yours. To her I must
      have appeared harsh: I <i>was</i> severe; but when I thought I had been
      deceived, duped, can you wonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen turned her eyes away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Miss Stanley, why will not you distinguish? the cases are
      essentially different. Nine out of ten of the young ladies who marry in
      these countries do not marry the first object of their fancy, and whenever
      there is, as there will be, I am sure, in your case, perfect candour, I do
      not apprehend the slightest danger to the happiness of either party. On
      the contrary, I should foretell an increase of esteem and love. Beauclerc
      has often&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beauclerc&rsquo;s voice was at this instant heard in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Compose yourself, my dear Miss Stanley&mdash;this way,&rdquo; said the general,
      opening a door into the conservatory, for he heard Beauclerc&rsquo;s step now in
      the library. The general followed Helen as she left the room, and touching
      the bag that contained the letters, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember, whatever may be your hurry, lock this up first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; answered she; &ldquo;I will, I will!&rdquo; and she hastened on, and in a
      moment she was safe across the hall and upstairs, without meeting any one,
      and in her own room, and the bag locked up in her cabinet. Lady Davenant&rsquo;s
      bell rang as she went to her apartment; she looked in at Cecilia, who
      started up in her bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All is over,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;all is well. I have the letters locked up; I
      cannot stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen disengaged herself almost forcibly from Cecilia&rsquo;s embrace, and she
      was in Lady Davenant&rsquo;s room in another minute. She bade her good morning
      as composedly as she could, she thought quite as usual. But that was
      impossible: so much the better, for it would not have been natural this
      last morning of Lady Davenant&rsquo;s stay, when nothing was as usual externally
      or internally. All was preparation for departure&mdash;her maids packing&mdash;Lady
      Davenant, making some last arrangements&mdash;in the midst of which she
      stopped to notice Helen&mdash;pressed her in her arms, and after looking
      once in her face, said, &ldquo;My poor child! it must be so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elliott interrupted, asking some question, purposely to draw off her
      attention; and while she turned about to give some orders to another
      servant, Elliott said to Miss Stanley, &ldquo;My Lady was not well last night;
      she must be kept from all that can agitate her, as much as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen at that instant rejoiced that she had done what she had. She agreed
      with Elliott, she said, that all emotion which could be avoided should;
      and upon this principle busied herself, and was glad to employ herself in
      whatever she could to assist the preparations, avoiding all conversation
      with Lady Davenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, my love&mdash;quite right,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant. &ldquo;The best
      way is always to employ one&rsquo;s self always to the last. Yes, put up those
      drawings carefully, in this portfolio, Elliott; take silver paper, Helen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were Helen&rsquo;s own drawings, so all went on, and all was safe&mdash;even
      when Cecilia was spoken of; while the silver paper went over the drawings,
      Helen answered that she had seen her. &ldquo;She was not well, but still not
      seriously ill, though&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant; &ldquo;only the general is too anxious about her&mdash;very
      naturally. He sent me word just now,&rdquo; continued she, &ldquo;that he has
      forbidden her to get up before breakfast. I will go and see her now; dear
      Cecilia! I hope she will do well&mdash;every way&mdash;I feel sure of it,
      Helen&mdash;sure as you do yourself, my dear&mdash;But what is the
      matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo; said Helen. That was not quite true; but she could not help it&mdash;&ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo;
       repeated she. &ldquo;Only I am anxious, my dear Lady Davenant,&rdquo; continued poor
      Helen blundering, unaccustomed to evasions&mdash;&ldquo;only I am very anxious
      you should go soon to Cecilia; I know she is awake now, and you will be
      hurried after breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elliott looked reproachfully at Miss Stanley, for she thought it much
      better for her lady to be engaged in more indifferent matters till after
      breakfast, when she would have but a few minutes to spend with her
      daughter; so Helen, correcting herself, added&mdash;&ldquo;But, perhaps I&rsquo;m
      wrong, so do not let me interrupt you in whatever you are doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant; &ldquo;you do not know what you are saying
      or doing yourself this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But no suspicion was excited in her mind, as she accounted for Helen&rsquo;s
      perturbation by the sorrow of their approaching separation, and by the
      hurry of her spirits at Beauclerc&rsquo;s arrival the day before. And then came
      the meeting the general at breakfast, which Helen dreaded; but so
      composed, so impenetrable was he that she could hardly believe that
      anything could have occurred that morning to agitate him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Davenant, after being with her daughter, came to take leave of Helen,
      and said gravely, &ldquo;Helen! remember what I said of Cecilia&rsquo;s truth, my
      trust is in you. Remember, if I never see you again, by all the love and
      esteem I bear you, and all which you feel for me, remember this my last
      request&mdash;prayer&mdash;adjuration to you, support, save Cecilia!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the general came to announce that the carriage was ready;
      promptly he led her away, handed her in and the order to &ldquo;drive on,&rdquo; was
      given. Lady Davenant&rsquo;s last look, her last anxious smile, was upon Helen
      and Beauclerc as they stood beside each other on the steps, and she was
      gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen was so excessively agitated that Beauclerc did not attempt to detain
      her from hurrying to her own room, where she sat down, and endeavoured to
      compose herself. She repeated Lady Davenant&rsquo;s last words, &ldquo;Support, save
      Cecilia,&rdquo; and, unlocking the cabinet in which she had deposited the fatal
      letters, she seized the bag that contained them, and went immediately to
      Cecilia. She was in her dressing-room, and the general sitting beside her
      on the sofa, upon which she was resting. He was sitting directly opposite
      to Helen as she entered; she started at the sight of him: his eye
      instantly fell upon the bag, and she felt her face suddenly flush. He took
      out his watch, said he had an appointment, and was gone before Helen
      raised her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dearest friend, come to me, come close to me,&rdquo; cried Cecilia, and
      throwing her arms round Helen, she said, &ldquo;Oh, I am the happiest creature
      now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you?&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that I am, and I thank you for it; how much I thank you, Helen, it
      is impossible to express, and better I love you than anything upon earth
      but Clarendon himself, my best friend, my generous Helen. Oh, Clarendon
      has been so kind, so very kind! so sorry for having alarmed me! He is a
      noble, charming creature. I love him a thousand times better than I ever
      did, am happier than I ever was! and all this I owe to you, dearest Helen.
      But I cannot get your eyes from that bag,&mdash;what have you there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The letters,&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The letters!&rdquo; exclaimed Cecilia, springing up, &ldquo;give them to me,&rdquo; seizing
      and opening the bag. &ldquo;Oh that dreadful perfume! Helen open the window, and
      bolt the door, my dear&mdash;both doors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Helen was doing so, Cecilia struck one little quick blow on a
      taper-lighter; it flared, and when Helen turned, one of the letters was in
      flames, and Cecilia continued feeding the flame with them as fast as ever
      it could devour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Burn! burn! there, there!&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;I would not look at any one of
      them again for the world; I know no more what is in them than if I had
      never written them, except those horrid, horrid words Clarendon saw and
      showed me. I cannot bear to think of it. There now,&rdquo; continued she, as
      they burned, &ldquo;no one can ever know anything more about the matter: how
      glad I am to see them burning!&mdash;burnt! safe! The smell will go off in
      a minute or two. It is going,&mdash;yes, gone! is not it? Now we may
      breathe freely. But you look as if you did not know whether you were glad
      or sorry, Helen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe it was right; the general advised me to lock, them up,&rdquo; said
      Helen, &ldquo;but then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he? how thoughtful of him! But better to burn them at once; I am sure
      it was not my fault that they were not long ago destroyed. I was assured
      by that abominable man&mdash;but no matter, we will never think of him
      again. It is done now&mdash;no, not completely yet,&rdquo; said she, looking
      close at the half white, half black burnt paper, in which words, and whole
      lines still appeared in shrunken but yet quite legible characters. &ldquo;One
      cannot be too careful,&rdquo; and she trampled on the burnt paper, and scattered
      the cinders. Helen was anxious to speak, she had something important to
      say, but hesitated; she saw that Cecilia&rsquo;s thoughts were so far from what
      she wanted to speak of that she could not instantly say it; she could not
      bear to overturn all Cecilia&rsquo;s present happiness, and yet, said to
      herself, I must&mdash;I must&mdash;or what may happen hereafter? Then
      forcing herself to speak, she began, &ldquo;Your mother is safe now, Cecilia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, and thank you, thank you for that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then now, Cecilia&mdash;your promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My promise!&rdquo; Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s eyes opened in unfeigned astonishment. &ldquo;What
      promise?&mdash;Oh, I recollect, I promised&mdash;did I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Cecilia, surely you cannot have forgotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know the reason I consented was to prevent the danger of any shock to
      Lady Davenant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I know, but what did I promise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words had in reality passed Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s lips at the time without
      her at all considering them as a promise, only as a means of persuasion to
      bring Helen to her point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did I promise?&rdquo; repeated she. &ldquo;You said, &lsquo;As soon as my mother is
      safe, as soon as she is gone, I will tell my husband all,&rsquo;&mdash;Cecilia,
      you cannot forget what you promised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, now I remember it perfectly, but I did not mean so soon. I never
      imagined you would claim it so soon: but some time I certainly will tell
      him all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not put it off, dearest Cecilia. It must be done&mdash;let it be done
      to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day!&rdquo; Lady Cecilia almost screamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you why,&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day!&rdquo; repeated Lady Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we let the present <i>now</i> pass,&rdquo; continued Helen, &ldquo;we shall lose
      both the power and the opportunity, believe me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not the power, Helen, and I do not know what you mean by the
      opportunity,&rdquo; said Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have a reason now to give General Clarendon&mdash;a true good reason,
      for what we have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reason!&rdquo; cried Lady Cecilia, &ldquo;what can you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That it was to prevent danger to your mother, and now she is safe; and if
      you tell him directly, he will see this was, really so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true; but I cannot&mdash;wait till to-morrow, at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every day will make it more difficult. The deception will be greater, and
      less pardonable. If we delay, it will become deliberate falsehood, a sort
      of conspiracy between us,&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Conspiracy! Oh, Helen, do not use such a shocking word, when it is really
      nothing at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why not tell it?&rdquo; urged Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, though it is nothing at all in reality, yet Clarendon would
      think it dreadful&mdash;though I have done nothing really wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I say&mdash;so I know,&rdquo; cried Helen; &ldquo;therefore&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore let me take my own time,&rdquo; said Cecilia. &ldquo;How can you urge me
      so, hurrying me so terribly, and when I am but just recovered from one
      misery, and when you had made me so happy, and when I was thanking you
      with all my heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen was much moved, but answered as steadily as she could. &ldquo;It seems
      cruel, but indeed I am not cruel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you had raised me up,&rdquo; continued Cecilia, &ldquo;to dash me down again,
      and leave me worse than ever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not worse&mdash;no, surely not worse, when your mother is safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, safe, thank you&mdash;but oh, Helen, have you no feeling for your
      own Cecilia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The greatest,&rdquo; answered Helen; and her tears said the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, Helen! I never could have thought you would have urged me so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Cecilia! if you knew the pain it was to me to make you unhappy again,&mdash;but
      I assure you it is for your own sake. Dearest Cecilia, let me tell you all
      that General Clarendon said about it, and then you will know my reasons.&rdquo;
       She repeated as quickly as she could, all that had passed between her and
      the general, and when she came to this declaration that, if Cecilia had
      told him plainly the fact before, he would have married with perfect
      confidence, and, as he believed, with increased esteem and love: Cecilia
      started up from the sofa on which she had thrown herself, and exclaimed,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O that I had but known this at the time, and I <i>would</i> have told
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is still time,&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time now?&mdash;impossible. His look this morning. Oh! that look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is one look, my dear Cecilia, compared with a whole life of
      confidence and happiness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A life of happiness! never, never for me; in that way at least, never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that way and no other, Cecilia, believe me. I am certain you never
      could endure to go on concealing this, living with him you love so, yet
      deceiving him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deceiving! do not call it deceiving, it is only suppressing a fact that
      would give him pain; and when he can have no suspicion, why give him that
      pain? I am afraid of nothing now but this timidity of yours&mdash;this
      going back. Just before you came in, Clarendon was saying how much he
      admired your truth and candour, how much he is obliged to you for saving
      him from endless misery; he said so to me, that was what made me so
      completely happy. I saw that it was all right for you as well as me, that
      you had not sunk, that you had risen in his esteem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I must sink, Cecilia, in his esteem, and now it hangs upon a single
      point&mdash;upon my doing what I cannot do.&rdquo; Then she repeated what the
      general had said about that perfect openness which he was sure there would
      be in this case between her and Beauclerc. &ldquo;You see what the general
      expects that I should do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Cecilia; and then indeed she looked much disturbed. &ldquo;I am very
      sorry that this notion of your telling Beauclerc came into Clarendon&rsquo;s
      head&mdash;very, very sorry, for he will not forget it. And yet, after
      all,&rdquo; continued she, &ldquo;he will never ask you point blank, &lsquo;Have you told
      Beauclerc?&rsquo;&mdash;and still more impossible that he should ask Beauclerc
      about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cecilia!&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;if it were only for myself I would say no more;
      there is nothing I would not endure&mdash;that I would not sacrifice&mdash;even
      my utmost happiness.&rdquo;&mdash;She stopped, and blushed deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dearest Helen! do you think I could let you ever hazard that? If I
      thought there was the least chance of injuring you with Granville!&mdash;I
      would do any thing&mdash;I would throw myself at Clarendon&rsquo;s feet this
      instant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This instant&mdash;I wish he was here,&rdquo; cried Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heavens! do you?&rdquo; cried Lady Cecilia, looking at the door with
      terror&mdash;she thought she heard his step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if you would but tell him&mdash;O let me call him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, no! Spare me&mdash;spare me, I cannot speak now. I could not utter
      the words; I should not know what words to use. Tell him if you will, I
      cannot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I tell him?&rdquo; said Helen, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no&mdash;that would be worse; if anybody tells him it must be
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you will now&mdash;when he comes in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is coming!&rdquo; cried Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Clarendon came to the door&mdash;it was bolted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a few minutes,&rdquo; said Helen. Lady Cecilia did not speak, but listened,
      as in agony, to his receding footsteps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a few minutes, Helen, did you say?&mdash;then there is nothing for me
      now, but to die&mdash;I wish I could die&mdash;I wish I was dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen felt she was cruel, she began to doubt her own motives; she thought
      she had been selfish in urging Cecilia too strongly; and, going to her
      kindly, she said, &ldquo;Take your own time, my dear Cecilia: only tell him&mdash;tell
      him soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, I will indeed, when I can&mdash;but now I am quite exhausted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are indeed,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;how cruel I have been!&mdash;how pale you
      are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia lay down on the sofa, and Helen covered her with a soft India
      shawl, trembling so much herself that she could hardly stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, thank you, dear, kind Helen; tell him I am going to sleep, and
      I am sure I hope I shall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen closed the shutters&mdash;she had now done all she could; she feared
      she had done too much; and as she left the room, she said to herself,&mdash;&ldquo;Oh,
      Lady Davenant! if you could see&mdash;if you knew&mdash;what it cost me!&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The overwrought state of Helen&rsquo;s feelings was relieved by a walk with
      Beauclerc, not in the dressed part of the park, but in what was generally
      undiscovered country: a dingle, a bosky dell, which he had found out in
      his rambles, and which, though so little distant from the busy hum of men,
      had a wonderful air of romantic seclusion and stillness&mdash;the
      stillness of evening. The sun had not set; its rich, red light yet
      lingered on the still remaining autumn tints upon the trees. The birds
      hopped fearlessly from bough to bough, as if this sweet spot were all
      their own. The cattle were quietly grazing below, or slowly winding their
      way to the watering-place. By degrees, the sounds of evening faded away
      upon the ear; a faint chirrup here and there from the few birds not yet
      gone to roost, and now only the humming of the flies over the water were
      to be heard.

    <p>
      It was perfect repose, and Beauclerc and Helen sat down on the bank to
      enjoy it together. The sympathy of the woman he loved, especially in his
      enjoyment of the beauties of nature, was to Beauclerc an absolute
      necessary of life. Nor would he have been contented with that show taste
      for the picturesque, which is, as he knew, merely one of a modern young
      lady&rsquo;s many accomplishments. Helen&rsquo;s taste was natural, and he was glad to
      feel it so true, and for him here alone expressed with such peculiar
      heightened feeling, as if she had in all nature now a new sense of
      delight. He had brought her here, in hopes that she would be struck with
      this spot, not only because it was beautiful in itself, and his discovery,
      but because it was like another bushy dell and bosky bourne, of which he
      had been from childhood fond, in another place, of which he hoped she
      would soon be mistress. &ldquo;Soon! very soon, Helen!&rdquo; he repeated, in a tone
      which could not be heard by her with indifference. He said that some of
      his friends in London told him that the report of their intended union had
      been spread everywhere&mdash;(by Lady Katrine Hawksby probably, as
      Cecilia, when Lady Castlefort departed, had confided to her, to settle her
      mind about Beauclerc, that he was coming over as Miss Stanley&rsquo;s
      acknowledged lover). And since the report had been so spread, the sooner
      the marriage took place the better; at least, it was a plea which
      Beauclerc failed not to urge, and Helen&rsquo;s delicacy failed not to feel.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sighed&mdash;she smiled. The day was named&mdash;and the moment she
      consented to be his, nothing could be thought of but him. Yet, even while
      he poured out all his soul&mdash;while he enjoyed the satisfaction there
      is in perfect unreservedness of confidence, Helen felt a pang mix with her
      pleasure. She felt there was one thing <i>she</i> could <i>not</i> tell
      him: he who had told her every thing&mdash;all his faults, and follies.
      &ldquo;Oh! why,&rdquo; thought she, &ldquo;why cannot I tell him every thing? I, who have no
      secrets of my own&mdash;why should I be forced to keep the secrets of
      another?&rdquo; In confusion, scarcely finished, these ideas came across her
      mind, and she sighed deeply. Beauclerc asked why, and she could not tell
      him! She was silent; and he did not reiterate the indiscreet question. He
      was sure she thought of Lady Davenant; and he now spoke of the regret he
      felt that she could not be present at their marriage, and Lord Davenant
      too! Beauclerc said he had hoped that Lord Davenant, who loved Helen as if
      she were his own daughter, would have been the person to act as her father
      at the ceremony. But the general, his friend and her&rsquo;s, would now,
      Beauclerc said, give her to him; and would, he was sure, take pleasure in
      thus publicly marking his approbation of his ward&rsquo;s choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      They rose, and going on down the path to the river&rsquo;s side, they reached a
      little cove where he had moored his boat, and they returned home by water&mdash;the
      moon just visible, the air so still; all so placid, so delightful, and
      Beauclerc so happy, that she could not but be happy; yes&mdash;quite happy
      too. They reached the shore just as the lamps were lighting in the house.
      As they went in, they met the general, who said, &ldquo;In good time;&rdquo; and he
      smiled on Helen as she passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all settled,&rdquo; whispered Beauclerc to him; &ldquo;and you are to give her
      away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With pleasure,&rdquo; said the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Helen went up-stairs, she said to herself, &ldquo;I understand the general&rsquo;s
      smile; he thinks I have followed his advice; he thinks I have told all&mdash;and
      I&mdash;I can only be silent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a great dinner party, but the general, not thinking Cecilia
      quite equal to it, had engaged Mrs. Holdernesse, a relation of his own, to
      do the honours of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia came into the drawing-room in the evening; but, after paying
      her compliments to the company, she gladly followed the general&rsquo;s advice,
      and retired to the music-room: Helen went with her, and Beauclerc
      followed. Lady Cecilia sat down to play at ecarté with him, and Helen
      tuned her harp. The general came in for a few minutes, he said, to escape
      from two young ladies, who had talked him half dead about craniology. He
      stood leaning on the mantelpiece, and looking over the game. Lady Cecilia
      wanted counters, and she begged Beauclerc to look for some which she
      believed he would find in the drawer of a table that was behind him.
      Beauclerc opened the drawer, but no sooner had he done so, than, in
      admiration of something he discovered there, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Beautiful!
      beautiful! and how like!&rdquo; It was the miniature of Helen, and besides the
      miniature, further back in the drawer, Lady Cecilia saw&mdash;how quick is
      the eye of guilty fear!&mdash;could it be?&mdash;yes&mdash;one of the
      fatal letters&mdash;<i>the</i> letter! Nothing but the picture had yet
      been seen by the general or by Beauclerc: Lady Cecilia stretched behind
      her husband, whose eyes were upon the miniature, and closed the drawer. It
      was all she could do, it was impossible for her to reach the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauclerc, holding the picture to the light, repeated, &ldquo;Beautiful! who did
      it? whom is it for? General, look! do you know it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to be sure,&rdquo; replied the general; &ldquo;Miss Stanley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have seen it before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the general, coldly. &ldquo;It is very like. Who did it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did it,&rdquo; cried Lady Cecilia, who now recovered her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, my dear Lady Cecilia! Whom for? for me? is it for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For you? It may be, hereafter, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh thank you, my dear Lady Cecilia!&rdquo; cried Beauclerc.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you behave well, perhaps,&rdquo; added she.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general heard in his wife&rsquo;s tremulous tone, and saw in her half
      confusion, half attempt at playfulness, only an amiable anxiety to save
      her friend, and to give her time to recover from her dismay. He at once
      perceived that Helen had not followed the course he had suggested; that
      she had not told Beauclerc, and did not intend that he should be told the
      whole truth. The general looked extremely grave; Beauclerc gave a glance
      round the room. &ldquo;Here is some mystery,&rdquo; said he, now first seeing Helen&rsquo;s
      disconcerted countenance. Then he turned on the general a look of eager
      inquiry. &ldquo;Some mystery, certainly,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;with which I am not to be
      made acquainted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there be any mystery,&rdquo; said the general, &ldquo;with which you are not to be
      made acquainted, I am neither the adviser nor abettor. Neither in jest nor
      earnest am I ever an adviser of mystery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While her husband thus spoke, Lady Cecilia made another attempt to possess
      herself of the letter. This time she rose decidedly, and, putting aside
      the little ecarté table which was in her way, pressed forward to the
      drawer, saying something about &ldquo;counters.&rdquo; Her Cachemere caught on Helen&rsquo;s
      harp, and, in her eager spring forward, it would have been overset, but
      that the general felt, turned, and caught it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you about, my dear Cecilia?&mdash;what do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, nothing, thank you, my dear; nothing now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she did not dare to open the drawer, or to let him open it, and
      anxiously drew away his attention by pointing to a footstool which she
      seemed to want.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could not you ask me for it, my dear, without disturbing yourself? What
      are men made for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beauclerc, after a sort of absent effort to join in quest of the
      footstool, had returned eagerly to the picture, and looking at it more
      closely, he saw the letters C.D. written in small characters in one
      corner; and, just as his eye turned to the other corner, Lady Cecilia,
      recollecting what initials were there, started up and snatched it from his
      hand. &ldquo;Oh, Granville!&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;you must not look at this picture any
      more till I have done something to it.&rdquo; Beauclerc was trying to catch
      another look at it, when Cecilia cried out, &ldquo;Take it, Helen! take it!&rdquo; and
      she held it up on high, but as she held it, though she turned the face
      from him, she forgot, quite forgot that Colonel D&rsquo;Aubigny had written his
      name on the back of the picture; and there it was in distinct characters
      such as could be plainly read at that height, &ldquo;<i>For</i> Henry
      D&rsquo;Aubigny.&rdquo; Beauclerc saw, and gave one glance at Helen. He made no
      further attempt to reach the picture. Lady Cecilia, not aware of what he
      had seen, repeated, &ldquo;Helen! Helen! why don&rsquo;t you take it?&mdash;now! now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen could not stir. The general took the picture from his wife&rsquo;s hand,
      gave it to Miss Stanley, without looking at her, and said to Lady Cecilia,
      &ldquo;Pray keep yourself quiet, Cecilia. You have done enough, too much to-day;
      sit down,&rdquo; said he, rolling her arm-chair close, and seating her. &ldquo;Keep
      yourself quiet, I beg.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I beg,&rdquo; in the tone of &ldquo;I insist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat down, but catching a view of Beauclerc was alarmed by his aspect&mdash;and
      Helen! her head was bent down behind the harp. Lady Cecilia did not know
      yet distinctly what had happened. The general pressed her to lean back on
      the cushions which he was piling up behind her. Beauclerc made a step
      towards Helen, but checking himself, he turned to the ecarté table. &ldquo;Those
      counters, after all, that we were looking for&mdash;&rdquo; As he spoke he
      pulled open the drawer. The general with his back to him was standing
      before Lady Cecilia, she could not see what Beauclerc was doing, but she
      heard the drawer open, and cried out. &ldquo;Not there, Beauclerc; no counters
      there&mdash;you need not look there.&rdquo; But before she spoke, he had given a
      sudden pull to the drawer, which brought it quite out, and all the
      contents fell upon the floor, and there was the fatal letter, open, and
      the words &ldquo;<i>My dear, too dear Henry</i>&rdquo; instantly met his eyes; he
      looked no farther, but in that single glance the writing seemed to him to
      be Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s, and quick his eye turned upon her. She kept perfectly
      quiet, and appeared to him perfectly composed. His eye then darted in
      search of Helen; she had sunk upon a seat behind the harp. Through the
      harp-strings he caught a glimpse of her face, all pale&mdash;crimsoned it
      grew as he advanced: she rose instantly, took up the letter, and, without
      speaking or looking at any one, tore it to pieces. Beauclerc in motionless
      astonishment. Lady Cecilia breathed again. The general&rsquo;s countenance
      expressed &ldquo;I interfere no farther.&rdquo; He left the room; and Beauclerc,
      without another look at Helen, followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some moments after Lady Cecilia and Helen were left alone, there was a
      dead silence. Lady Cecilia sat with her eyes fixed upon the door through
      which her husband and Beauclerc had passed. She thought that Beauclerc
      might return; but when she found that he did not, she went to Helen, who
      had covered her face with her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dearest friend,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia, &ldquo;thank you! thank you!&mdash;you
      did the best that was possible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Cecilia!&rdquo; exclaimed Helen, &ldquo;to what have you exposed me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did it all happen?&rdquo; continued Cecilia. &ldquo;Why was not that letter burnt
      with the rest? How came it there? Can you tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;I cannot recollect.&rdquo; But after some effort,
      she remembered that in the morning, while the general had been talking to
      her, she had in her confusion, when she took the packet, laid the picture
      and that letter beside her on the arm of the chair. She had, in her hurry
      of putting the other letters into her bag, forgotten this and the picture,
      and she supposed that they had fallen between the chair and the wall, and
      that they had been found and put into the table-drawer by one of the
      servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen was hastening out of the room, Cecilia detained her. &ldquo;Do not go, my
      dear, for that would look as if you were guilty, and you know you are
      innocent. At the first sound of your harp Beauclerc will return&mdash;only
      command yourself for one hour or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it will only be for an hour or two,&rdquo; said Helen, brightening with
      hope. &ldquo;You will tell the general to-night Do you think Granville will come
      back? Where is the harp key?&mdash;I dropped it&mdash;here it is.&rdquo; She
      began to tune the harp. Crack went one string&mdash;then another. &ldquo;That is
      lucky,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia, &ldquo;it will give you something to do, my love, if
      the people come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The aide-de-camp entered. &ldquo;I thought I heard harp-strings going,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Several!&mdash;yes,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia, standing full in his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Inauspicious sounds for us! had omens for my embassy.&mdash;Mrs.
      Holdernesse sent me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia, &ldquo;and you will have the goodness to tell her
      that Miss Stanley&rsquo;s harp is unstrung.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I be of any use, Miss Stanley?&rdquo; said he, moving towards the harp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; cried Lady Cecilia, &ldquo;you are in my service,&mdash;attend to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me, Lady Cecilia! I did not hear what you said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what I complain of&mdash;hear me now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am all attention, I am sure. What are your commands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave him as many as his head could hold. A long message to Mrs.
      Holdernesse, and to Miss Holdernesse and Miss Anna about their
      music-books, which had been left in the carriage, and were to be sent for,
      and duets to be played, and glees, for the major and Lady Anne Ruthven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heavens! I cannot remember any more,&rdquo; cried the aide-de-camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then go off, and say and do all that before you come back again,&rdquo; said
      Lady Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What amazing presence of mind you have!&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;How can you say so
      much, and think of every thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The aide-de-camp performed all her behests to admiration, and was rewarded
      by promotion to the high office of turner-over general of the leaves of
      the music books, an office requiring, as her ladyship remarked to Miss
      Holdernesse, prompt eye and ear, and all his distinguished gallantry. By
      such compliments she fixed him to the piano-forte, while his curiosity and
      all his feelings, being subordinate to his vanity, were prevented from
      straying to Miss Stanley and her harp-stringing, a work still doing&mdash;still
      to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the arrangement succeeded as Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s arrangements usually did.
      Helen heard the eternal buzz of conversation and the clang of instruments,
      and then the harmony of music, all as in a dream, or as at the theatre,
      when the thoughts are absent or the feelings preoccupied; and in this
      dreamy state she performed the operation of putting in the harp-strings
      quite well: and when she was at last called upon by Cecilia, who gave her
      due notice and time, she sat and played automatically, without soul or
      spirit&mdash;but so do so many others. It passed &ldquo;charmingly,&rdquo; till a door
      softly opened behind her, and she saw the shadow on the wall, and some one
      stood, and passed from behind her. There was an end of her playing;
      however, from her just dread of making a scene, she commanded herself so
      powerfully, that, except her timidity, nothing was observed by the
      company, and that timidity was pitied by the good-natured Mrs.
      Holdernesse, who said to her daughter, &ldquo;Anne, we must not press Miss
      Stanley any more; she, who is always so obliging, is tired now.&rdquo; She then
      made way for Helen to pass, who, thanking her with such a look as might be
      given for a life saved, quitted the harp, and the crowd, closing behind
      her, happily thought of her no more. She retreated to the darkest part of
      the room, and sat down. She did not dare to look towards what she most
      wished to see. Her eyes were fixed upon the face of the young lady
      singing, and yet she saw not one feature of that face, while she knew,
      without looking, or seeming to look, exactly where Beauclerc stood. He had
      stationed himself in a doorway into the drawing-room; there, leaning back
      against the wall, he stood, and never stirred. Helen was so anxious to get
      one clear view of the expression of his countenance, that at last she
      ventured to move a little, and from behind the broad back of a great man
      she looked: Beauclerc&rsquo;s eyes met hers. How different from their expression
      when they were sitting on the bank together but a few short hours before!
      He left the doorway instantly, and placed himself where Helen could see
      him no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all the rest of what passed this evening she knew nothing; she felt
      only a sort of astonishment at everybody&rsquo;s gaiety, and a sense of the time
      being intolerably long. She thought that all these people never would go
      away&mdash;that their carriages never would be announced. But before it
      came to that time, General Clarendon insisted upon Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s
      retiring. &ldquo;I must,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;play the tyrant, Cecilia; you have done too
      much to-day&mdash;Mrs. Holdernesse shall hold your place.&rdquo; He carried
      Cecilia off, and Helen thought, or fancied, that he looked about for her.
      Glad to escape, she followed close behind. The general did not offer his
      arm or appear to notice her. When she came to the door leading to the
      staircase, there was Beauclerc, standing with folded arms, as in the
      music-room; he just bowed his head, and wished Lady Cecilia a good night,
      and waited, without a word, for Helen to pass, or not to pass, as she
      thought fit. She saw by his look that he expected explanation; but till
      she knew what Cecilia meant to do, how could she explain? To say nothing&mdash;to
      bear to be suspected,&mdash;was all she could do, without betraying her
      friend. That word <i>betray</i>&mdash;that thought ruled her. She passed
      him: &ldquo;Good night&rdquo; she could not then say. He bowed as she passed, and she
      heard no &ldquo;Good night&rdquo;&mdash;no sound. And there was the general in the
      hall to be passed also, before she could reach the staircase up which
      Cecilia was going. When he saw Helen with a look of surprise&mdash;as it
      seemed to her, of disapproving surprise&mdash;he said, &ldquo;Are you gone, Miss
      Stanley?&rdquo; The look, the tone, struck cold to her heart. He continued&mdash;&ldquo;Though
      I drove Cecilia away, I did not mean to drive you away too. It is early.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it? I thought it was very late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;and if you <i>can</i>, I hope you will return.&rdquo; There was a
      meaning in his eye, which she well understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;if I can certainly&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you can and will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! thank you; but I must first&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; see Cecilia, she was going
      to say, but, afraid of implicating her, she changed the sentence to&mdash;&ldquo;I
      must first consider&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consider! what the devil!&rdquo; thought he, and his countenance was instantly
      angrily suited to the thought. Helen hesitated. &ldquo;Do not let me detain&mdash;distress
      you farther, Miss Stanley, unavailingly; and since I shall not have the
      pleasure of seeing you again this evening,&rdquo; concluded he, in a constrained
      voice, &ldquo;I have the honour to wish you a good night.&rdquo; He returned to the
      music-room.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Helen instantly went to Cecilia&rsquo;s room; Felicie was with her. Helen
      expected Lady Cecilia would dismiss her instantly; but mademoiselle was
      chattering. Helen had sometimes thought Cecilia let her talk too much, but
      to-night it was insufferable. Helen was too impatient, too anxious to bear
      it. &ldquo;Cecilia, my dear, I want to speak to you alone, as soon as you can,
      in my own room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as possible,&rdquo; Cecilia answered in a voice not natural. And she
      came, but not as soon as possible&mdash;shut the door behind her, showing
      that she had not dismissed Felicie, and, with hair dishevelled, as if
      hastening back to her room, said, &ldquo;I am in a hurry; the general ordered me
      to make haste, and not to be an hour undressing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not keep you a moment,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;I am in as great a hurry as
      you can be. Beauclerc is waiting for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waiting for you at this time of night! Oh! my dear, he cannot be standing
      there with his arms folded all this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen repeated what the general had said, and ended with, &ldquo;I am determined
      to return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No no,&rdquo; Lady Cecilia said. The general could not advise her going back at
      this time of night. And with rapidity and confusion, she poured out a
      multitude of dissuasive arguments, some contradicting the others. &ldquo;At this
      time of night! The world is not gone, and Beauclerc is in the midst of
      them by this time, you may be sure. You don&rsquo;t think he is standing alone
      there all this time. You could not speak to him before all the world&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      attempt it. You would only expose yourself. You would make a scene at last&mdash;undo
      all, and come to disgrace, and ruin me and yourself. I know you would,
      Helen. And if you were to send for him&mdash;into the library&mdash;alone!
      the servants would know it&mdash;and the company gone! And after all, for
      you, my dear, to make the first advance to reconciliation! If he is angry&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t think that would be quite&mdash;dignified; quite like you, Helen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The general thinks it right, and I am sure he would not advise any thing
      improper&mdash;undignified. It does not signify, Cecilia, I am determined&mdash;I
      will go.&rdquo; Trembling, she grew absolutely desperate from fear. &ldquo;I am afraid
      you have forgot your promise, Cecilia; you said that if I could bear it
      for one hour, it would be over. Did you not promise me that if any
      difficulty came between me and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped short. She had
      felt indignant; but when she looked at Cecilia, and saw her tears, she
      could not go on. &ldquo;Oh Helen!&rdquo; cried Cecilia, &ldquo;I do not ask you to pity me.
      You cannot know what I suffer&mdash;you are innocent&mdash;and I have done
      so wrong! You cannot pity me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do, I do,&rdquo; cried Helen, &ldquo;from the bottom of my heart. Only trust me,
      dear Cecilia; let me go down&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia sprang between her and the door. &ldquo;Hear Me! hear me, Helen! Do
      not go to-night, and, cost what it will&mdash;cost me what it may, since
      it has come to this between you, I will confess all this night&mdash;I
      will tell all to the general, and clear you with him and with Granville.
      What more can you ask?&mdash;what more can I do, Helen? And will you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No no, my dear Cecilia. Since you promise me this, I will not go now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be satisfied then, and rest&mdash;for me there is no rest;&rdquo; so saying
      Cecilia slowly left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen could not sleep: this was the second wretched night she had passed
      in that most miserable of all uncertainty&mdash;whether she was right or
      wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning, to Helen&rsquo;s astonishment, Cecilia&rsquo;s first words were about
      a dream&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, my dear Helen, I have had such a dream! I do not
      usually mind dreams in the least, but I must own to you that this has made
      an impression! My dear, I can hardly tell it; I can scarcely bear to think
      of it. I thought that Clarendon and I were sitting together, and my hand
      was on his shoulder; and I had worked myself up&mdash;I was just going to
      speak. He was winding up his watch, and I leaned forward to see his face
      better. He looked up-and it was not him: it was Colonel D&rsquo;Aubigny come to
      life. The door opened, Clarendon appeared&mdash;his eyes were upon me; but
      I do not know what came afterwards; all was confusion and fighting. And
      then I was with that nurse my mother recommended, and an infant in her
      arms. I was going to take the child, when Clarendon snatched it, and threw
      it into the flames. Oh! I awoke with a scream!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How glad you must have been,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;to awake and find it was only
      a dream!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But when I screamed,&rdquo; continued Cecilia, &ldquo;Clarendon started up, and asked
      if I was in pain. &lsquo;Not of body,&rsquo; I said;&mdash;and then&mdash;oh, Helen!
      then I thought I would begin. &lsquo;Not of body,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;but of mind;&rsquo; then I
      added, &lsquo;I was thinking of Helen and Beauclerc,&rsquo; Clarendon said, &lsquo;So was I;
      but there is no use in thinking of it; we can do no good.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; I
      said, &lsquo;suppose, Clarendon&mdash;only suppose that Helen, without saying
      any thing, were to let this matter pass off with Beauclerc?&rsquo;&mdash;Clarendon
      answered, &lsquo;It would not pass off with Beauclerc.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;But,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I
      do not mean without any explanation at all. Only suppose that Helen did
      not enter into any particulars, do not you think, Clarendon, that things
      would go on well enough?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; he said decidedly, &lsquo;no.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Do
      you mean,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;that things would not go on at all?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I do not
      say, not at all,&rsquo; he answered; &lsquo;but <i>well</i> they would not go on.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure the general is right,&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; continued Lady Cecilia, &ldquo;then I put the question differently. I
      wanted to feel my way, to try whether I could possibly venture upon my own
      confession. &lsquo;Consider it this way, Clarendon,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;Take it for
      granted that Helen did somehow arrange that Beauclerc were to be satisfied
      without any formal explanation.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Formal!&rsquo; said he,&mdash;&lsquo;I will
      not say formal,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;but without a <i>full</i> explanation: in short,
      suppose that from mere timidity, Helen could not, did not, exactly tell
      him the whole before marriage&mdash;put it off till afterwards&mdash;then
      told him all candidly; do you think, Clarendon, that if you were in
      Beauclerc&rsquo;s place (I quite stammered when I came to this)&mdash;do you
      think you could pardon, or forgive, or esteem, or love,&rsquo; I intended to end
      with, but he interrupted me with&mdash;&lsquo;I do not know,&rsquo; very shortly; and
      added, &lsquo;I hope this is not what Miss Stanley intends to do?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! what did you answer?&rdquo; cried Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said I did not know. My dear Helen, it was the only thing I could say.
      What would Clarendon have thought, after all my <i>supposes</i>, if I had
      said any thing else? he must have seen the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that he is not to see,&rdquo; said Helen: &ldquo;and how false he must think me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; for I told him,&rdquo; continued Lady Cecilia, &ldquo;that I was sure you
      wished always to tell the whole truth about everything, but that there
      might be circumstances where you really could not; and where I, knowing
      all the circumstances, could not advise it. He said, &lsquo;Cecilia, I desire
      you will not advise or interfere any farther in this matter. Promise me,
      Cecilia!&rsquo; He spoke sternly, and I promised as fast as I could. &lsquo;Do
      nothing, say nothing more about it,&rsquo; he repeated; and now, after that,
      could I go on, Helen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed; I do not think you could. My dear Cecilia, I really think you
      could not,&rdquo; said Helen, much moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you forgive me, my dear, good&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo; But seeing Helen
      change colour, Lady Cecilia, following her eye, and looking out of the
      window, started up, exclaiming, &ldquo;There is Beauclerc; I see him in my
      mother&rsquo;s walk. I will go to him this minute; yes, I will trust him&mdash;I
      will tell him all instantly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen caught hold of her, and stopped her. Surprised, Cecilia said, &ldquo;Do
      not stop me. I may never have the courage again if stopped now. Do not
      stop me, Helen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must, Cecilia. General Clarendon desired you not to interfere in the
      matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is not interfering, only interposing to prevent mischief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Cecilia,&rdquo; continued Helen eagerly, &ldquo;another reason has just struck
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish reasons would not strike you. Let me go. Oh, Helen; it is for
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it is for you I speak, Cecilia,&rdquo; said Helen, as fast as she could.
      &ldquo;If you told Beauclerc, you never could afterwards tell the general; it
      would be a new difficulty. You know the general could never endure your
      having confessed this to any man but himself&mdash;trusted Beauclerc
      rather than your husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia stopped, and stood silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Cecilia,&rdquo; continued Helen, &ldquo;you must leave me to my own judgment
      now;&rdquo; and, breaking from Cecilia, she left the room. She hurried out to
      meet Beauclerc. He stopped on seeing her, and then came forward with an
      air of evident deliberation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you wish to speak to me, Miss Stanley!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Stanley!&rdquo; cried Helen; &ldquo;is it come to this, and without hearing me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without hearing you, Helen! Was not I ready last night to hear you?
      Without hearing you! Have not you kept me in torture, the worst of
      tortures&mdash;suspense? Why did not you speak to me last night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot tell you,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I can tell you, Helen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will. Helen, you could not speak to me till you had consulted&mdash;arranged&mdash;settled
      what was to be said&mdash;what not to be said&mdash;what told&mdash;what
      left untold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Between each half sentence he darted looks at her, defying hers to
      contradict&mdash;and she could not contradict by word or look. &ldquo;You could
      not speak,&rdquo; continued he passionately, &ldquo;till you had well determined what
      was to be told&mdash;what left untold to me! To me, Helen, your confiding&mdash;devoted&mdash;accepted
      lover! for I protest before Heaven, had I knelt at the altar with you,
      Helen Stanley, not more yours, not more mine could I have deemed you&mdash;not
      more secure of your love and truth&mdash;your truth, for what is love
      without it!&mdash;not more secure of perfect felicity could I have been on
      earth than I was when we two sat together but yesterday evening on that
      bank. Your words&mdash;your looks&mdash;and still your looks&mdash;But
      what signify tears!&mdash;Tears, women&rsquo;s tears! Oh! what is woman!&mdash;and
      what is man that believes in her?&mdash;weaker still?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear me!&mdash;hear me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear you?&mdash;No, Helen, do not now ask me to hear you.&mdash;Do not
      force me to hear you.&mdash;Do not debase, do not sully, that perfect
      image of truth.&mdash;Do not sink yourself, Helen, from that height at
      which it was my entranced felicity to see you. Leave me one blessed, one
      sacred illusion. No,&rdquo; cried he, with increasing vehemence, &ldquo;say nothing of
      all you have prepared&mdash;not one arranged word conned over in your
      midnight and your morning consultations,&rdquo; pointing back to the window of
      her dressing-room, where he had seen her and Lady Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw,&rdquo; Helen began&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&mdash;Am I blind, think you?&mdash;I wish I were. Oh! that I could
      be again the believing, fond, happy dupe I was but yesterday evening!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dupe!&rdquo; repeated Helen. &ldquo;But pour out all&mdash;all, dear Granville. Think&mdash;say&mdash;what
      you will&mdash;reproach&mdash;abuse me as you please. It is a relief&mdash;take
      it&mdash;for I have none to give.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None!&rdquo; cried he, his tone suddenly changing, &ldquo;no relief to give!&mdash;What!
      have you nothing to say?&mdash;No explanation?&mdash;Why speak to me then
      at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell you so at once&mdash;to end your suspense&mdash;to tell you that
      I cannot explain. The midnight consultation and the morning, were not to
      prepare for you excuse or apology, but to decide whether I could tell you
      the whole; and since that cannot be, I determined not to enter into any
      explanation. I am glad that you do not wish to hear any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer me one question,&rdquo; said he:&mdash;&ldquo;that picture-did you give it to
      Colonel D&rsquo;Aubigny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. That is a question I can answer. No&mdash;he stole it from Cecilia&rsquo;s
      portfolio. Ask me no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One question more&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not one more&mdash;I cannot tell you anything more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent for a moment, he withdrew his eyes, and she went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Granville! I must now put your love and esteem for me to the test. If
      that love be what I believe it to be; if your confidence in me is what I
      think it ought to be, I am now going to try it. There is a mystery which I
      cannot explain. I tell you this, and yet I expect you to believe that I am
      innocent of anything wrong but the concealment. There are circumstances
      which I cannot tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why?&rdquo; interrupted Beauclerc.&mdash;&ldquo;Ought there to be any
      circumstances which cannot be told to the man to whom you have plighted
      your faith? Away with this &lsquo;cannot&mdash;this mystery!&rsquo; Did not I tell you
      every folly of my life&mdash;every fault? And what is this?&mdash;in
      itself, nothing!&mdash;concealment everything&mdash;Oh! Helen&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was going to say, &ldquo;If it concerned only myself,&rdquo;&mdash;but that would
      at once betray Cecilia, and she went on.&mdash;&ldquo;If it were in my opinion
      right to tell it to you, I would. On this point, Granville, leave me to
      judge and act for myself. This is the test to which I put your love&mdash;put
      mine to any test you will, but if your confidence in me is not sufficient
      to endure this trial, we can never be happy together.&rdquo; She spoke very low:
      but Beauclerc listened with such intensity that he could not only
      distinguish every syllable she said, but could distinctly hear the beating
      of her heart, which throbbed violently, in spite of all her efforts to be
      calm. &ldquo;Can you trust me?&rdquo; concluded she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can,&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;I can&mdash;I do! By Heaven I do! I think you an
      angel, and legions of devils could not convince me of the contrary. I
      trust your word&mdash;I trust that heavenly countenance&mdash;I trust
      entirely&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He offered, and she took his offered hand. &ldquo;I
      trust entirely. Not one question more shall I ask&mdash;not a suspicion
      shall I have: you put me to the test, you shall find me stand it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you?&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;you know how much I ask. I acknowledge a mystery,
      and yet I ask you to believe that I am not wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;you shall see.&rdquo; And both in happiness once more, they
      returned to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love her a thousand times better than ever,&rdquo; thought Beauclerc, &ldquo;for
      the independence of mind she shows in thus braving my opinion, daring to
      set all upon the cast&mdash;something noble in this! I am to form my own
      judgment of her, and I will, independently of what any other human being
      may say or think. The general, with his strict, narrow, conventional
      notions, has not an idea of the kind of woman I like, or of what Helen
      really is. He sees in Helen only the discreet proper-behaved young lady,
      adapted, so nicely adapted to her place in society, to nitch and notch in,
      and to be of no sort of value out of it. Give me a being able to stand
      alone, to think and feel, decide and act, for herself. Were Helen only
      what the general thinks her, she would not be for me; while she is what I
      think her, I love&mdash;I adore!&rdquo; And when he saw his guardian, Beauclerc
      declared that, though Helen had entered into no explanations, he was
      perfectly satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general answered, &ldquo;I am glad you <i>are</i> satisfied.&rdquo; Beauclerc
      perceived that the general was not; and in spite of all that he had just
      been saying to himself, this provoked and disgusted him. His theory of his
      own mind, if not quite false, was still a little at variance with his
      practice. His guardian&rsquo;s opinion swayed him powerfully, whenever he
      believed that it was not designed to influence him; when the opinion was
      repressed, he could not rest without drawing it out. &ldquo;Then, you think,
      general,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that some explanation ought to have been made?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter what I think, Granville, the affair is yours. If you are
      satisfied, that is all that is necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then even, because left on their own point of suspension to vibrate
      freely, the diamond-scales of Beauclerc&rsquo;s mind began to move, from some
      nice, unseen cause of variation. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;General Clarendon, no
      one can judge without knowing facts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I apprehend,&rdquo; said the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may be of too easy faith,&rdquo; replied Beauclerc.&mdash;[No reply.] &ldquo;This
      is a point of honour.&rdquo;&mdash;[No denial.] &ldquo;My dear general, if there be
      anything which weighs with you, and which you know and I do not, I think,
      as my friend and my guardian, you ought to tell it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; said the general, turning away from Beauclerc as he spoke,
      and striking first one heel of his boot against the scraper at the
      hall-door, then the other&mdash;&ldquo;pardon me, Granville, I cannot admit you
      to be a better judge than I am myself of what I ought to do or not to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tone was dry and proud, but Beauclerc&rsquo;s provoked imagination conceived
      it to be also mysterious; the scales of his mind vibrated again, but he
      had said he would trust&mdash;trust entirely, and he would: yet he could
      not succeed in banishing all doubt, till an idea started into his head&mdash;&ldquo;That
      writing was Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s! I thought so at the first moment, and I let it
      go again. It is hers, and Helen is keeping her secret:&mdash;but could
      Lady Cecilia be so ungenerous&mdash;so treacherous?&rdquo; However, he had
      declared he would ask no questions; he was a man of honour, and he would
      ask none&mdash;none even of himself&mdash;a resolution which he found it
      surprisingly easy to keep when the doubt concerned only Lady Cecilia.
      Whenever the thought crossed his mind, he said to himself, &ldquo;I will ask
      nothing&mdash;suspect nobody; but if it is Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s affair, it is
      all the more generous in Helen.&rdquo; And so, secure in this explanation,
      though he never allowed to himself that he admitted it, his trust in Helen
      was easy and complete, and his passion for her increased every hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Lady Cecilia was disturbed even by the perfect confidence and
      happiness of Beauclerc&rsquo;s manner towards Helen. She could not but fear that
      he had guessed the truth; and it seemed as if everything which happened
      tended to confirm him in his suspicions; for, whenever the mind is
      strongly interested on any subject, something alluding to it seems
      wonderfully, yet accidentally, to occur in everything that we read, or
      hear in common conversation, and so it now happened; things were
      continually said by persons wholly unconcerned, which seemed to bear upon
      her secret. Lady Cecilia frequently felt this with pangs of confusion,
      shame, and remorse; and, though Beauclerc did not watch, or play the spy
      upon her countenance, he could not help sometimes observing the flitting
      colour&mdash;the guilty changes of countenance&mdash;the assumed
      composure: that mind, once so artless, began to be degraded&mdash;her
      spirits sank; she felt that she &ldquo;had lost the sunshine of a soul without a
      mystery!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The day fixed for the marriage approached; Lady Cecilia had undertaken the
      superintendence of the <i>trousseau</i>, and Felicie was in anxious
      expectation of its arrival. Helen had written to the Collingwoods to
      announce the intended event, asking for the good bishop&rsquo;s sanction, as her
      guardian, and regretting that he could not perform the ceremony. She had
      received from Lady Davenant a few lines, written just before she sailed,
      warm with all the enthusiasm of her ardent heart, and full of expectation
      that Helen&rsquo;s lot would be one of the happiest this world could afford. All
      seemed indeed to smile upon her prospects, and the only clouds which
      dimmed the sunshine were Cecilia&rsquo;s insincerity, and her feeling that the
      general thought her acting unhandsomely and unwisely towards his ward; but
      she consoled herself with the thought that he could not judge of what he
      did not know, that she did not deserve his displeasure, that Granville was
      satisfied, and if he was, why should not General Clarendon be so too? Much
      more serious, however, was the pain she felt on Cecilia&rsquo;s account. She
      reproached herself with betraying the trust Lady Davenant had reposed in
      her. That dreadful prophecy seemed now accomplishing: Cecilia&rsquo;s natural
      generosity, that for which Helen had ever most loved and admired her, the
      brightest, fairest parts of her character, seemed failing now; what could
      be more selfish than Cecilia&rsquo;s present conduct towards herself, more
      treacherous to her noble minded, her confiding husband! The openness, the
      perfect unreserve between the two friends, was no longer what it had been.
      Helen, however, felt the constraint between them the less as she was
      almost constantly with Beauclerc, and in her young happiness she hoped all
      would be right. Cecilia would tell the general, and they would be as
      intimate, as affectionate, as they had ever been.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning General Clarendon, stopping Cecilia as she was coming down to
      breakfast, announced that he was obliged to set off instantly for London,
      on business which could not be delayed, and that she must settle with Miss
      Stanley whether they would accompany him or remain at Clarendon Park. He
      did not know, he said, how long he might be detained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia was astonished, and excessively curious; she tried her utmost
      address to discover what was the nature of his business, in vain. All that
      remained was to do as he required without more words. He left the room,
      and Cecilia decided at once that they had better accompany him. She
      dreaded some delay; she thought that, if the general went alone to town,
      he might be detained Heaven knows how long; and though the marriage must
      be postponed at all events, yet if they went with the general, the
      ceremony might be performed in town as well as at Clarendon Park; and she
      with some difficulty convinced Helen of this. Beauclerc feared nothing but
      delay. They were to go. Lady Cecilia announced their decision to the
      general, who immediately set off, and the others in a few hours followed
      him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my youth, and through the prime of manhood, I never entered London
      without feelings of hope and pleasure. It was to me the grand theatre of
      intellectual activity, the field for every species of enterprise and
      exertion, the metropolis of the world, of business, thought, and action.
      There, I was sure to find friends and companions, to hear the voice of
      encouragement and praise. There, society of the most refined sort offered
      daily its banquets to the mind, and new objects of interest and ambition
      were constantly exciting attention either in politics, literature, or
      science.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These feelings, so well described by a man of genius, have probably been
      felt more or less by most young men who have within them any consciousness
      of talent, or any of that enthusiasm, that eager desire to have or to give
      sympathy, which, especially in youth, characterises noble natures. But
      after even one or two seasons in a great metropolis these feelings often
      change long before they are altered by age. Granville Beauclerc had
      already persuaded himself that he now detested, as much as he had at first
      been delighted with, a London life. From his metaphysical habits of mind,
      and from the sensibility of his temper, he had been too soon disgusted by
      that sort of general politeness which, as he said, takes up the time and
      place of real friendship; and as for the intellectual pleasures, they
      were, he said, too superficial for him; and his notions of independence,
      too, were at this time quite incompatible with the conventional life of a
      great capital. His present wish was to live all the year round in the
      country, with the woman he loved, and in the society of a few chosen
      friends. Helen quite agreed with him in his taste for the country; she had
      scarcely ever known any other life, and yet had always been happy; and
      whatever youthful curiosity had been awakened in her mind as to the
      pleasures of London, had been now absorbed by stronger and more tender
      feelings. Her fate in life, she felt, was fixed, and wherever the man she
      loved wished to reside, that, she felt, must be her choice. With these
      feelings they arrived at General Clarendon&rsquo;s delightful house in town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen&rsquo;s apartment, and Cecilia&rsquo;s, were on different floors, and had no
      communication with each other. It was of little consequence, as their stay
      in town was to be but short, yet Helen could not help observing that
      Cecilia did not express any regret at it, as formerly she would have done;
      it seemed a symptom of declining affection, of which, every the slightest
      indication was marked and keenly felt by Helen, the more so because she
      had anticipated that such must be the consequence of all that had passed
      between them, and there was now no remedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the first morning visitors admitted were Lady Castlefort and Lady
      Katrine Hawksby. They did not, as it struck Cecilia, seem surprised to see
      that Miss Stanley was Miss Stanley still, though the day for the marriage
      had been announced in all the papers as fixed; but they did seem now full
      of curiosity to know how it had come to pass, and there was rather too
      apparent a hope that something was going wrong. Their first inquisitive
      look was met by Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s careless glance in reply, which said better
      than words could express, &ldquo;Nothing the matter, do not flatter yourselves.&rdquo;
       Then her expertness at general answers which give no information,
      completely baffled the two curious impertinents. They could only learn
      that the day for the marriage was not fixed, that it could not be
      definitively named till some business should be settled by the general.
      Law business they supposed, of course. Lady Cecilia &ldquo;knew nothing about
      it. Lawyers are such provoking wretches, with their fast bind fast find.
      Such an unconscionable length of time as they do take for their parchment
      doings, heeding nought of that little impatient flapper Cupid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Certain that Lady Cecilia was only playing with their curiosity, yet
      unable to circumvent her, Lady Katrine changed the conversation, and Lady
      Castlefort preferred a prayer, which was, she said, the chief object of
      her visit, that Lady Cecilia and Miss Stanley would come to her on Monday;
      she was to have a few friends&mdash;a very small party, and independently
      of the pleasure she should have in seeing them, it would be advantageous
      perhaps to Miss Stanley, as Lady Castlefort, in her softest voice, added,
      &ldquo;For from the marriage being postponed even for a few days, people might
      talk, and Mr. Beauclerc and Miss Stanley appearing together would prevent
      anybody&rsquo;s thinking there was any little&mdash;Nothing so proper now as for
      a young lady to appear with her <i>futur</i>; so I shall expect you, my
      dear Cecilia, and Miss Stanley,&rdquo;&mdash;and so saying, she departed.
      Helen&rsquo;s objections were all overruled, and when the engagement was made
      known to Beauclerc, he shrugged, and shrank, and submitted; observing,
      &ldquo;that all men, and all women, must from the moment they come within the
      precincts of London life, give up their time and their will to an
      imaginary necessity of going when we do not like it, where we do not wish,
      to see those whom we have no desire to see, and who do not care if they
      were never to see us again, except for the sake of their own reputation of
      playing well their own parts in the grand farce of mock civility&rdquo; Helen
      was sorry to have joined in making an engagement for him which he seemed
      so much to dislike. But Lady Cecilia, laughing, maintained that half his
      reluctance was affectation, and the other half a lover-like spirit of
      monopoly, in which he should not be indulged, and instead of pretending to
      be indifferent to what the world might think, he ought to be proud to show
      Helen as a proof of his taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      In dressing Helen this night, Felicie, excited by her lady&rsquo;s exhortations,
      displayed her utmost skill. Mademoiselle Felicie had a certain <i>petite
      métaphysique de toilette</i>, of which she was justly vain. She could
      talk, and as much to the purpose as most people of &ldquo;le genre classique,&rdquo;
       and &ldquo;le genre romantique,&rdquo; of the different styles of dress that suit
      different styles of face; and while &ldquo;she worked and wondered at the work
      she made,&rdquo; she threw out from time to time her ideas on the subject to
      form the taste of Helen&rsquo;s little maid. Rose, who, in mute attention, held
      the light and assiduously presented pins. &ldquo;Not your pin so fast one after
      de other Miss Rose&mdash;Tenez! tenez!&rdquo; cried mademoiselle. &ldquo;You tink in
      England alway too much of your pin in your dress, too little of our taste&mdash;too
      little of our elegance, too much of your what you call <i>tidiness</i>, or
      God know what! But never you mind dat so much, Miss Rose; and you not prim
      up your little mouth, but listen to me. Never you put in one pin before
      you ask yourself, Miss Rose, what for I do it? In every toilette that has
      taste there is above all&mdash;tenez&mdash;a character&mdash;a sentiment
      to be support; suppose your lady is to be superbe, or she will rather be
      élégante, or charmante, or intéressante, or distinguée&mdash;well, dat is
      all ver&rsquo; well, and you dress to that idée, one or oder&mdash;well, very
      well&mdash;but none of your wat you call <i>odd</i>. No, no, never, Miss
      Rose&mdash;dat is not style noble; &lsquo;twill only become de petit minois of
      your English originale. I wash my hand of dat always.&rdquo; The toilette
      superbe mademoiselle held to be the easiest of all those which she had
      named with favour, it may be accomplished by any common hands; but <i>head</i>
      is requisite to reach the toilette distinguée. The toilette superbe
      requires only cost&mdash;a toilette distinguée demands care. There was a
      happiness as well as care in Felicie&rsquo;s genius for dress, which, ever
      keeping the height of fashion in view, never lost sight of nature,
      adapting, selecting, combining to form a perfect whole, in which art
      itself concealed appeared only, as she expressed it, in the sublime of
      simplicity. In the midst of all her talking, however, she went on with the
      essential business, and as she finished, pronounced &ldquo;Précepte commence,
      exemple achève.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they arrived at Lady Castlefort&rsquo;s, Lady Cecilia was surprised to find
      a line of carriages, and noise, and crowds of footmen. How was this? She
      had understood that it was to be one of those really small parties, those
      select reunions of some few of the high and mighty families who chance to
      be in town before Christmas.&mdash;&ldquo;But how is this?&rdquo; Lady Cecilia
      repeated to herself as she entered the hall, amazed to find it blazing
      with light, a crowd on the stairs, and in the anteroom a crowd, as she
      soon felt, of an unusual sort. It was not the soft crush of aristocracy,
      they found hard unaccustomed citizen elbows,&mdash;strange
      round-shouldered, square-backed men and women, so over-dressed, so
      bejewelled, so coarse&mdash;shocking to see, impossible to avoid; not one
      figure, one face, Lady Cecilia had ever seen before; till at last, from
      the midst of the throng emerged a fair form&mdash;a being as it seemed of
      other mould, certainly of different caste. It was one of Cecilia&rsquo;s former
      intimates&mdash;Lady Emily Greville, whom she had not seen since her
      return from abroad. Joyfully they met, and stopped and talked; she was
      hastening away, Lady Emily said, &ldquo;after having been an hour on duty; Lady
      Castlefort had made it a point with her to stay after dinner, she had
      dined there, and had stayed, and now guard was relieved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who are all these people? What is all this, my dear Lady Emily?&rdquo;
       asked Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not you know? Louisa has trapped you into coming then, to-night
      without telling you how it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word did she tell me, I expected to meet only our own world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very different world you perceive this! A sort of farce this is to the
      &lsquo;Double Distress,&rsquo; a comedy;&mdash;in short, one of Lord Castlefort&rsquo;s
      brothers is going to stand for the City, and citizens and citoyennes must
      be propitiated. When an election is in the case all other things give
      place: and, besides, he has just married the daughter of some amazing
      merchant, worth I don&rsquo;t know how many plums; so <i>le petit Bossu</i>, who
      is proud of his brother, for he is reckoned the genius of the family! made
      it a point with Louisa to do this. She put up her eyebrows, and stood out
      as long as she could, but Lord Castlefort had his way, for he holds the
      purse you know,&mdash;and so she was forced to make a party for these
      Goths and Vandals, and of course she thought it best to do it directly,
      out of season, you know, when nobody will see it&mdash;and she consulted
      me whether it should be large or small; I advised a large party, by all
      means, as crowded as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I understand,&rdquo; said Cecilia; &ldquo;to hide the shame in the
      multitude; vastly well, very fair all this, except the trapping us into
      it, who have nothing to do with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing to do with it! pardon me,&rdquo; cried Lady Emily. &ldquo;It could not have
      been done without us. Entrapping us!&mdash;do not you understand that we
      are the baits to the traps? Bringing those animals here, wild beasts or
      tame, only to meet one another, would have been &lsquo;doing business no how.&rsquo; 
      We are what they are &lsquo;come for to see,&rsquo; or to have it to say that they
      have seen the Exclusives, Exquisites, or Transcendentals, or whatever else
      they call us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Emily Greville&rsquo;s carriage!&rdquo; was now called in the anteroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go, but first make me known to your friend Miss Stanley, you see I
      know her by instinct;&rdquo; but &ldquo;Lady Emily Greville&rsquo;s carriage!&rdquo; now resounded
      reiteratedly, and gentlemen with cloaks stood waiting, and as she put hers
      on, Lady Emily stooped forward and whispered,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not believe one word of what they say of her,&rdquo; and she was off, and
      Lady Cecilia stood for an instant looking after her, and considering what
      she could mean by those last words. Concluding, however, that she had not
      heard aright, or had missed some intervening name, and that these words,
      in short, could not possibly apply to Helen, Lady Cecilia turned to her,
      they resumed their way onward, and at length they reached the grand
      reception-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the middle of that brilliantly lighted saloon, immediately under the
      centre chandelier, was ample verge and space enough reserved for the <i>élite</i>
      of the world; circle it was not, nor square, nor form regularly defined,
      yet the bounds were guarded. There was no way of getting to the further
      end of the saloon, or to the apartments open in the distance beyond it,
      except by passing through this enclosed space, in which one fair entrance
      was practicable, and one ample exit full in view on the opposite side.
      Several gentlemen of fashionable bearing held the outposts of this
      privileged place, at back of sofa, or side of fauteuil, stationary, or
      wandering near. Some chosen few were within; two caryatides gentlemen
      leaned one on each side of the fireplace, and in the centre of the rug
      stood a remarkably handsome man, of fine figure, perfectly dressed, his
      whole air exquisitely scornful, excruciatingly miserable, and loftily
      abstract. &lsquo;Twas wonderful, &lsquo;twas strange, &lsquo;twas passing strange! how one
      so lost to all sublunary concerns, so far above the follies of inferior
      mortals, as he looked, came here&mdash;so extremely well-dressed too! How
      happened it? so nauseating the whole, as he seemed, so wishing that the
      business of the world were done! With half-closed dreamy eyelids he looked
      silent down upon two ladies who sat opposite to him, rallying, abusing,
      and admiring him to his vanity&rsquo;s content. They gave him his choice of
      three names, l&rsquo;Ennuyé, le Frondeur, or le Blasé. L&rsquo;Ennuyé? he shook his
      head; too common; he would have none of it. Le Frondeur? no; too much
      trouble; he shrugged his abhorrence. Le Blasé? he allowed, might be too
      true. But would they hazard a substantive verb? He would give them
      four-and-twenty hours to consider, and he would take twenty-four himself
      to decide. They should have his definitive to-morrow, and he was sliding
      away, but Lady Castlefort, as he passed her, cried, &ldquo;Going, Lord
      Beltravers, going are you?&rdquo; in an accent of surprise and disappointment;
      and she whispered, &ldquo;I am hard at work here, acting receiver general to
      these city worthies; and you do not pity me&mdash;cruel!&rdquo; and she looked
      up with languishing eyes, that so begged for sympathy. He threw upon her
      one look of commiseration, reproachful. &ldquo;Pity you, yes! But why will you
      do these things? and why did you bring me here to do this horrid sort of
      work?&rdquo; and he vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia Clarendon and Miss Stanley now appeared in the <i>offing</i>,
      and now reached the straits: Lady Castlefort rose with vivacity
      extraordinary, and went forward several steps. &ldquo;Dear Cecilia! Miss
      Stanley, so good! Mr. Beauclerc, so happy! the general could not? so
      sorry!&rdquo; Then with hand pressed on hers, &ldquo;Miss Stanley, so kind of you to
      come. Lady Grace, give me leave&mdash;Miss Stanley&mdash;Lady Grace
      Bland,&rdquo; and in a whisper, &ldquo;Lord Beltravers&rsquo; aunt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Grace, with a haughty drawback motion, and a supercilious arching of
      her brows, was &ldquo;happy to have the honour.&rdquo; Honour nasally prolonged, and
      some guttural sounds followed, but further words, if words they were,
      which she syllabled between snuffling and mumbling, were utterly
      unintelligible; and Helen, without being &ldquo;very happy,&rdquo; or happy at all,
      only returned bend for bend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia then presented her to a group of sister graces standing near
      the sofas of mammas and chaperons&mdash;not each a different grace, but
      similar each, indeed upon the very same identical pattern air of
      young-lady fashion&mdash;well-bred, and apparently well-natured. No sooner
      was Miss Stanley made known to them by Lady Cecilia, than, smiling just
      enough, not a muscle too much, they moved; the ranks opened softly, but
      sufficiently, and Helen was in the group; amongst them, but not <i>of</i>
      them&mdash;and of this she became immediately sensible, though without
      knowing how or why. One of these daughters had had expectations last
      season from having been frequently Mr. Beauclerc&rsquo;s partner, and the mother
      was now fanning herself opposite to him. But Helen knew nought of this: to
      her all was apparently soft, smooth, and smiling. While, whenever any of
      the unprivileged multitude, the city monsters, passed near this high-born,
      high-bred group, they looked as though the rights of pride were infringed,
      and, smiling scorn, they dropped from half-closed lips such syllables of
      withering contempt, as they thought these vulgar victims merited: careless
      if they heard or not, rather rejoicing to see the sufferers wince beneath
      the wounds which they inflicted in their pride and pomp of sway. &ldquo;Pride!&rdquo;
       thought Helen, &ldquo;was it pride?&rdquo; If pride it was, how unlike what she had
      been taught to consider the proper pride of aristocracy; how unlike that
      noble sort which she had seen, admired, and loved! Helen fancied what Lady
      Davenant would have thought, how ignoble; how mean, how vulgar she would
      have considered these sneers and scoffs from the nobly to the lowly born.
      How unworthy of their rank and station in society! They who ought to be
      the first in courtesy, because the first in place.
    </p>
    <p>
      As these thoughts passed rapidly in Helen&rsquo;s mind, she involuntarily looked
      towards Beauclerc; but she was so encompassed by her present companions
      that she could not discover him. Had she been able to see his countenance,
      she would have read in it at once how exactly he was at that instant
      feeling with her. More indignant than herself, for his high chivalrous
      devotion to the fair could ill endure the readiness with which the
      gentlemen, attendants at ottoman or sofa, lent their aid to mock and to
      embarrass every passing party of the city tribe, mothers and their hapless
      daughter-train.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this instant Lady Bearcroft, who, if she had not good breeding,
      certainly had good-nature, came up to Beauclerc, and whispered earnestly,
      and with an expression of strong interest in her countenance, &ldquo;As you love
      her, do not heed one word you hear anybody say this night, for it&rsquo;s all on
      purpose to vex you; and I am certain as you are it&rsquo;s all false&mdash;all
      envy. And there she goes, Envy herself in the black jaundice,&rdquo; continued
      she, looking at Lady Katrine Hawksby, who passed at that instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heavens!&rdquo; cried Beauclerc, &ldquo;what can&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; interrupted Lady Bearcroft, &ldquo;no, no, do not ask&mdash;better
      not; best you should know no more&mdash;only keep your temper whatever
      happens. Go you up the hill, like the man in the tale, and let the black
      stones bawl themselves hoarse&mdash;dumb. Go you on, and seize your pretty
      singing thinking bird&mdash;the sooner the better. So fare you well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she disappeared in the crowd. Beauclerc, to whom she was perfectly
      unknown, (though she had made him out,) totally at a loss to imagine what
      interest she could take in Helen or in him, or what she could possibly
      mean, rather inclined to suppose she was a mad women, and he forgot
      everything else as he saw Helen with Lady Cecilia emerging from the bevy
      of young ladies and approaching him. They stopped to speak to some
      acquaintance, and he tried to look at Helen as if he were an indifferent
      spectator, and to fancy what he should think of her if he saw her now for
      the first time. He thought that he should be struck not only with her
      beauty, but with her graceful air&mdash;her ingenuous countenance, so
      expressive of the freshness of natural sensibility. She was exquisitely
      well dressed too, and that, as Felicie observed, goes for much, even with
      your most sensible men. Altogether he was charmed, whether considering her
      as with the eyes of an unbiased stranger or with his own. And all he heard
      confirmed, and, although he would not have allowed it, strengthened his
      feelings. He heard it said that, though there were some as handsome women
      in the room, there were none so interesting; and some of the young men
      added, &ldquo;As lovely as Lady Blanche, but with more expression.&rdquo; A citizen,
      with whom Beauclerc could have shaken hands on the spot, said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
      one of the highbreds, now, that&rsquo;s well-bred too.&rdquo; In the height of the
      rapture of his feelings he overtook Lady Cecilia, who telling him that
      they were going on to another room, delivered Helen to his care, and
      herself taking the arm of some ready gentleman, they proceeded as fast as
      they could through the crowd to the, other end of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the first time Helen had ever seen Lady Cecilia in public, where
      certainly she appeared to great advantage. Not thinking about herself, but
      ever willing to be pleased; so bright, so gay, she was sunshine which
      seemed to spread its beams wherever she turned. And she had something to
      say to everybody, or to answer quick to whatever they said or looked,
      happy always in the <i>àpropos</i> of the moment. Little there might be,
      perhaps, in what she said, but there was all that was wanted, just what
      did for the occasion. In others there often appeared a distress for
      something to say, or a dead dullness of countenance opposite to you. From
      others, a too fast hazarded broadside of questions and answers&mdash;glads
      and sorrys in chain-shots that did no execution, because there was no good
      aim&mdash;congratulations and condolences playing at cross purposes&mdash;These
      were mistakes, misfortunes, which could never occur in Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s
      natural grace and acquired tact of manner. Helen was amused, as she
      followed her, in watching the readiness with which she knew how to
      exchange the necessary counters in the commerce of society: she was
      amused, till her attention was distracted by hearing, as she and Beauclerc
      passed, the whispered words&mdash;&ldquo;<i>I promessi sposi</i>&mdash;look&mdash;<i>La
      belle fiancée</i>.&rdquo; These words were repeated as they went on, and Lady
      Cecilia heard some one say, &ldquo;I thought it was broken off; that was all
      slander then?&rdquo; She recollected Lady Emily&rsquo;s words, and, terrified lest
      Helen should hear more of&mdash;she knew not what, she began to talk to
      her as fast as she could, while they were stopped in the door-way by a
      crowd. She succeeded for the moment with Helen; she had not heard the last
      speech, and she could not, as long as Lady Cecilia spoke, hear more; but
      Beauclerc again distinguished the words &ldquo;<i>Belle fiancée</i>;&rdquo; and as he
      turned to discover the speaker, a fat matron near him asked, &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;
       and the daughter answered, &ldquo;It is that handsome girl, with the white rose
      in her hair.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said the brother, on whose arm she leaned;
      &ldquo;Handsome is that handsome does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Handsome does! thought Beauclerc: and the mysterious warning of his
      unknown friend recurred to him. He was astonished, alarmed, furious; but
      the whispering party had passed on, and just then Lady Cecilia descrying
      Mr. Churchill in the distance, she made towards him. Conversation sure to
      be had in abundance from him. He discerned them from afar, and was happily
      prepared both with a ready bit of wit and with a proper greeting. His
      meeting with Lady Cecilia was, of course, just the same as ever. He took
      it up where he left off at Clarendon Park; no difference, no hiatus. His
      bow to Beauclerc and Helen, to Helen and Beauclerc, joined in one little
      sweep of a congratulatory motion, was incomparable: it said everything
      that a bow could say, and more. It implied such a happy freedom from envy
      or jealousy; such a polite acquiescence in the decrees of fate; such a
      philosophic indifference; such a cool sarcastic superiority to the event;
      and he began to Lady Cecilia with one of his prepared impromptus: &ldquo;At the
      instant your ladyship came up, I am afraid I started, actually in a
      trance, I do believe. Methought I was&mdash;where do you think? In the
      temple of Jaggernaut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Methought,&rdquo; continued Horace, &ldquo;that I was in the temple of Jaggernaut&mdash;that
      one strange day in the year, when ill castes meet, when all distinction of
      castes and ranks is forgotten&mdash;the abomination of mixing them all
      together permitted, for their sins no doubt&mdash;high caste and low, from
      the abandoned Paria to the Brahmin prince, from their Billingsgate and
      Farringilon Without, suppose, up to their St. James&rsquo;s, Street and
      Grosvenor Square, mingle, mingle, ye who mingle may, white spirits and
      grey, black spirits and blue. Now, pray look around: is not this
      Jaggernaut night with Lady Castlefort?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia; &ldquo;are not you the great Jaggernaut himself,
      driving over all in your triumphant chariot of sarcasm, and crushing all
      the victims in your way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This took place with Horace; it put him in spirits, in train, and he fired
      away at Lady Castlefort, whom he had been flattering <i>à loutrance</i>
      five minutes before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I so admire that acting of sacrifice in your <i>belle cousine</i>
      to-night! Pasta herself could not do it better. There is a look of &lsquo;Oh, ye
      just gods! what a victim am I!&rsquo; and with those upturned eyes so charming!
      Well, and seriously it is a sad sacrifice. Fathers have flinty hearts by
      parental prescription; but husbands&mdash;<i>petit Bossus</i> especially&mdash;should
      have mercy for their own sakes; they should not strain their marital power
      too far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia, &ldquo;it is curious, that one born and bred such an
      ultra exclusive as Louisa Castlefort, should be obliged after her marriage
      immediately to open her doors and turn ultra liberale, or an universal
      suffragist&mdash;all in consequence of these <i>mésalliances</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, true,&rdquo; said Churchill, with a solemn, pathetic shake of the head.
      &ldquo;Gentlemen and noblemen should consider before they make these low matches
      to save their studs, or their souls, or their entailed estates. Whatever
      be the necessity, there can be no apology for outraging all <i>bienséance</i>.
      Necessity has no law, but it should have some decency. Think of, bringing
      upon a foolish elder brother&mdash;But we won&rsquo;t be personal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t pray, Horace,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia, moving on. &ldquo;But think, only
      think, my dear Lady Cecilia; think what it must be to be &lsquo;<i>How-d&rsquo;ye-doed</i>,&rsquo; 
      and to be &lsquo;dear sistered&rsquo; by such bodies as these in public.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sad! sad!&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old French nobility,&rdquo; continued Churchill, &ldquo;used to call these low
      money-matches, &lsquo;mettre du fumier sur nos terres.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dirty work at best,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But still,&rdquo; said Horace, &ldquo;it might be done with decency if not with
      majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But in the midst of all this,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia, &ldquo;I want some ice very
      much for myself, and for Helen more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a notion we shall find some here,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;if you will come
      on this way&mdash;in this <i>sanctum sanctorum</i> of Lady Katrine&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He led them on to a little inner apartment, where, as he said, Lady
      Katrine Hawksby and her set do always scandal take, and sometimes tea.&mdash;&ldquo;Tea
      and punch,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;you know, in London now is quite <i>à la
      Française</i>, and it is astonishing to me, who am but a man, what strong
      punch ladies can take.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only when it is iced,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; said he,&mdash;&ldquo;very refreshing ice, and more refreshing
      scandal, and here we have both in perfection. Scandal, hot and hot, and
      ice, cold and cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time they had reached the entrance to what he called Lady
      Katrine&rsquo;s <i>sanctum sanctorum</i>, where she had gathered round the iced
      punch and tea-table a select party, whom she had drawn together with the
      promise of the other half of a half-published report,&mdash;a report in
      which &ldquo;<i>I promessi Sposi</i>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>La belle fiancée</i>&rdquo; were
      implicated!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop here one moment,&rdquo; cried Churchill, &ldquo;one moment longer. Let us see
      before we are seen. Look in, look in pray, at this group. Lady Katrine
      herself on the sofa, finger up&mdash;holding forth; and the deaf old woman
      stretching forward to hear, while the other, with the untasted punch, sits
      suspended in curiosity. &lsquo;What can it be?&rsquo; she says, or seems to say. Now,
      now, see the pretty one&rsquo;s hands and eyes uplifted, and the ugly one, with
      that look of horror, is exclaiming, &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t say so, my dear Lady
      Katrine!&rsquo; Admirable creatures! Cant and scandal personified! I wish Wilkie
      were here&mdash;worth any money to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he should call it &lsquo;The scandal party,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia. &ldquo;He told
      me he never could venture upon a subject unless he could give it a good
      name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Lady Katrine, having finished her story, rose, and awaking
      from the abstraction of malice, she looked up and saw Helen and Lady
      Cecilia, and, as she came forward, Churchill whispered between them, &ldquo;Now&mdash;now
      we are going comfortably to enjoy, no doubt, Madame de Sevigné&rsquo;s pleasure
      &lsquo;de mal dire du prochain,&rsquo; at the right hour too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Churchill left them there. Lady Katrine welcoming her victims&mdash;her
      unsuspicious victims&mdash;he slid off to the friends round the tea-table
      to learn from &ldquo;Cant&rdquo; what &ldquo;Scandal&rdquo; had been telling. Beauclerc was gone
      to inquire for the carriage. The instant Helen appeared, all eyes were
      fixed upon her, and &ldquo;Belle fiancée&rdquo; was murmured round, and, Cecilia heard&mdash;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s
      much to be pitied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Lord Castlefort went up to Helen; she had always been a
      favourite of his; he was grateful to her for her constant kindness to him,
      and, peevish though the little man might be, he had a good heart, and he
      showed it now by instantly taking Helen out of the midst of the starers,
      and begging her opinion upon a favourite picture of his, a Madonna.&mdash;Was
      it a Raffaelle, or was it not? He and Mr. Churchill, he said, were at
      issue about it. In short, no matter what he said, it engrossed Helen&rsquo;s
      attention, so that she could not hear any thing that passed, and could not
      be seen by the starers; and he detained her in conversation till Beauclerc
      came to say&mdash;&ldquo;The carriage is ready, Lady Cecilia is impatient.&rdquo; Lord
      Castlefort opened a door that led at once to the staircase, so that they
      had not to recross all the rooms, but got out immediately. The smallest
      service merits thanks, and Helen thanked Lord Castlefort by a look which
      he appreciated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in the few words which Beauclerc had said as he announced the
      carriage, she had perceived that he was agitated, and, as he attended her
      in silence down the stairs, his look was grave and pre-occupied; she saw
      he was displeased, and she thought he was displeased with her. When he had
      put them into the carriage, he wished them good night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are not you coming with us?&rdquo; cried Lady Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he thanked her, he had rather walk, and,&rdquo; he added&mdash;&ldquo;I shall not
      see you at breakfast&mdash;I am engaged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Home!&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia, drawing up the glass with a jerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen looked out anxiously. Beauclerc had turned away, but she caught one
      more glance of his face as the lamp flared upon it&mdash;she saw, and she
      was sure that&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;Something is very much the matter&mdash;I am
      certain of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, my dear Helen,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia; &ldquo;the matter is, that he is
      tired to death, as I am sure I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s more than that,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;he is angry,&rdquo;&mdash;and she sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Helen, do not torment yourself about nothing,&rdquo; said Cecilia, who,
      not being sure whether Beauclerc had heard anything, had not looked at his
      countenance or remarked his tone; her mind was occupied with what had
      passed while Helen was looking at the Madonna. Lady Cecilia had tried to
      make out the meaning of these extraordinary starings and whisperings&mdash;Lady
      Katrine would not tell her any thing distinctly, but said, &ldquo;Strange
      reports&mdash;so sorry it had got into the papers, those vile libellous
      papers; of course she did not believe&mdash;of Miss Stanley. After all,
      nothing very bad&mdash;a little awkward only&mdash;might be hushed up.
      Better not talk of it to-night; but I will try, Cecilia, in the morning,
      to find those paragraphs for you.&rdquo; Lady Cecilia determined to go as early
      as possible in the morning, and make out the whole; and, had she plainly
      told this to Helen, it would have been better for all parties: but she
      continued to talk of the people they had seen, to hide her thoughts from
      Helen, who all the time felt as in a feverish dream, watching the lights
      of the carriage flit by like fiery eyes, while she thought only of the
      strange words she had heard and why they should have made Beauclerc angry
      with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last they were at home. As they went in, Lady Cecilia inquired if the
      general had come in?&mdash;Yes, he had been at home for some time, and was
      in bed. This was a relief. Helen was glad not to see any one, or to be
      obliged to say anything more that night. Lady Cecilia bade her &ldquo;be a good
      child, and go to sleep.&rdquo; How much Helen slept may be left to the judgment
      of those who have any imagination.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Miladi a une migranie affreuse</i> this morning,&rdquo; said Felicie,
      addressing herself on the stairs to Rose. &ldquo;<i>Mille amitiés de sa part</i>
      to your young lady, Miss Rose, and <i>miladi</i> recommend to her to
      follow a good example, and to take her breakfast in her bed, and then to
      take one good sleep till you shall hear <i>midi sonné</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Stanley, however, was up and dressed at the time when this message
      was brought to her, and a few minutes afterwards a footman came to the
      door, to give notice that the general was in the breakfast-room, waiting
      to know whether Miss Stanley was coming down or not. The idea of a <i>tête-à-tetê</i>
      breakfast with him was not now quite so agreeable as it would have been to
      her formerly, but she went down. The general was standing with his back to
      the fire, newspapers hanging from his hand, his look ominously grave.
      After &ldquo;Good mornings&rdquo; had been exchanged with awful solemnity, Helen
      ventured to hope that there was no bad public news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No public news whatever,&rdquo; said the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, she was sorry to hear that Cecilia had &ldquo;such a bad headache.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tired last night,&rdquo; said the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was, indeed, a tiresome, disagreeable party,&rdquo; said Helen, hoping this
      would lead to how so? or why? but the general drily answered, &ldquo;Not the
      London season,&rdquo; and went on eating his breakfast in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a constraint and awe came upon her, that she felt it would be taking
      too great a liberty, in his present mood, to put sugar and cream into his
      tea, as she was wont in happier times. She set sugar-bowl and cream before
      him, and whether he understood, or noticed not her feelings, she could not
      guess. He sugared, and creamed, and drank, and thought, and spoke not.
      Helen put out of his way a supernumerary cup, to which he had already
      given a push, and she said, &ldquo;Mr. Beauclerc does not breakfast with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I suppose,&rdquo; said the general, &ldquo;as he is not here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said he was engaged to breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With some of his friends, I suppose,&rdquo; said the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      There the dialogue came to a full stop, and breakfast, uncomfortably on
      her part, and with a preoccupied air on his, went on in absolute silence.
      At length the general signified to the servant who was in waiting, by a
      nod, and a look towards the door, that his further attendance was
      dispensed with. At another time Helen would have felt such a dismissal as
      a relief, for she disliked, and recollected that her uncle particularly
      disliked, the fashion of having servants waiting at a family breakfast,
      which he justly deemed unsuited to our good old English domestic habits;
      but somehow it happened that at this moment she was rather sorry when the
      servant left the room. He returned however in a moment, with something
      which he fancied to be yet wanting; the general, after glancing at
      whatever he had brought, said, &ldquo;That will do, Cockburn; we want nothing
      more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cockburn placed a screen between him and the fire; the general put it
      aside, and, looking at him, said sternly&mdash;&ldquo;Cockburn, no intelligence
      must ever go from my house to any newspapers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cockburn bowed&mdash;&ldquo;None shall, Sir, if I can prevent it; none ever did
      from me, general.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None must ever go from anyone in my family&mdash;look to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cockburn bowed again respectfully, but with a look of reservation of right
      of remonstrance, answered by a look from his master, of &ldquo;No more must be
      said.&rdquo; Yet Cockburn was a favourite; he had lived in the family from the
      time he was a boy. He moved hastily towards the door, and having turned
      the handle, rested upon it and said, &ldquo;general, I cannot answer for
      others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, Cockburn, I must find somebody who can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cockburn disappeared, but after closing the door the veteran opened it
      again, stood, and said stoutly, though seemingly with some impediment in
      his throat&mdash;&ldquo;General Clarendon, do me the justice to give me full
      powers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever you require: say, such are your orders from me, and that you
      have full power to dismiss whoever disobeys.&rdquo; Cockburn bowed, and withdrew
      satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another silence, when the general hastily finishing his breakfast, took up
      the newspaper, and said, &ldquo;I wished to have spared you the pain of seeing
      these, Miss Stanley, but it must be done now. There have appeared in
      certain papers, paragraphs alluding to Beauclerc and to you; these
      scandalous papers I never allow to enter my house, but I was informed that
      there were such paragraphs, and I was obliged to examine into them. I am
      sorry to find that they have some of them been copied into my paper
      to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laid the newspaper before her. The first words which struck her eye
      were the dreaded whispers of last night; the paragraph was as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a few days will be published the Memoirs of the late Colonel D&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;,
      comprising anecdotes, and original love-letters; which will explain the
      mysterious allusions lately made in certain papers to &lsquo;<i>La belle Fiancée</i>,&rsquo; 
      and &lsquo;<i>I promessi sposi</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed Helen; &ldquo;the letters! published!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general had turned from her as she read, and had gone to his
      writing-desk, which was at the furthest end of the room; he unlocked it,
      and took from it a small volume, and turning over the leaves as he slowly
      approached Helen, he folded down some pages, laid the volume on the table
      before her, and then said, &ldquo;Before you look into these scandalous memoirs,
      Miss Stanley, let me assure you, that nothing but the necessity of being
      empowered by you to say what is truth and what is falsehood, could
      determine me to give you this shock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was scarcely able to put forward her hand; yet took the book, opened
      it, looked at it, saw letters which she knew could not be Cecilia&rsquo;s, but
      turning another leaf, she pushed it from her with horror. It was the
      letter&mdash;beginning with &ldquo;My dear&mdash;too dear Henry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In print!&rdquo; cried she; &ldquo;In print! published!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not published yet, that I hope to be able to prevent,&rdquo; said the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether she heard, whether she could hear him, he was not certain, her
      head was bent down, her hands clasping her forehead. He waited some
      minutes, then sitting down beside her, with a voice of gentleness and of
      commiseration, yet of steady determination, he went on:&mdash;&ldquo;I <i>must</i>
      speak, and you <i>must</i> hear me, Helen, for your own sake, and for
      Beauclerc&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;I hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear then the words of a friend, who will be true to you through life&mdash;through
      life and death, if you will be but true to yourself, Helen Stanley&mdash;a
      friend who loves you as he loves Beauclerc; but he must do more, he must
      esteem you as he esteems Beauclerc, incapable of any thing that is false.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen listened with her breath suspended, not a word in reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I ask&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She put her hand upon his arm, as if to stop
      him; she had a foreboding that he was going to ask something that she
      could not, without betraying Cecilia, answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are not yet sufficiently collected, I will wait; take your own
      time&mdash;My question is simple&mdash;I ask you to tell me whether <i>all</i>
      these letters are your&rsquo;s or not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; cried Helen, &ldquo;these letters are not mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not all,&rdquo; said the general: &ldquo;this first one I know to be yours, because I
      saw it in your handwriting; but I am certain all cannot be yours: now will
      you show me which are and which are not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will take them to my own room, and consider and examine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not look at them here, Miss Stanley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She wanted to see Cecilia, she knew she could never answer the question
      without consulting her, but that she could not say; still she had no other
      resource, so, conquering her trembling, she rose and said, &ldquo;I would rather
      go to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to Cecilia,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;to that I object: what can Cecilia do for you?
      what can she advise, but what I advise, that the plain truth should be
      told?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could! O if I could!&rdquo; cried Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can you mean? Pardon me, Miss Stanley, but surely you can tell the
      plain fact; you can recollect what you have written&mdash;at least you can
      know what you have not written. You have not yet even looked beyond a few
      of the letters&mdash;pray be composed&mdash;be yourself. This business it
      was that brought me to town. I was warned by that young lady, that poetess
      of Mr. Churchill&rsquo;s, whom you made your friend by some kindness at
      Clarendon Park&mdash;I was warned that there was a book to come out, these
      Memoirs of Colonel D&rsquo;Aubigny, which would contain letters said to be
      yours, a publication that would be highly injurious to you. I need not
      enter into details of the measures I consequently took; but I ascertained
      that Sir Thomas D&rsquo;Aubigny, the elder brother of the colonel, knows nothing
      more of the matter than that he gave a manuscript of his brother&rsquo;s, which
      he had never read, to be published: the rest is a miserable intrigue
      between booksellers and literary manufacturers, I know not whom; I have
      not been able to get to the bottom of it; sufficient for my present
      purpose I know, and must tell you. You have enemies who evidently desire
      to destroy your reputation, of course to break your marriage. For this
      purpose the slanderous press has been set at work, the gossiping part of
      the public has had its vile curiosity excited, the publication of this
      book is expected in a few days: this is the only copy yet completed, I
      believe, and this I could not get from the bookseller till this morning; I
      am now going to have every other copy destroyed directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh my dear, dear friend, how can I thank you?&rdquo; Her tears gushed forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank me not by words, Helen, but by actions; no tears, summon your soul&mdash;be
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O if I could but retrieve one false step!&rdquo;&mdash;she suddenly checked
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood aghast for an instant, then recovering himself as he looked upon
      her and marked the nature of her emotion, he said: &ldquo;There can be no false
      step that you could ever have taken that cannot be retrieved. There can
      have been nothing that is irretrievable, except falsehood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Falsehood! No,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;I will not say what is false&mdash;therefore
      I will not say anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then since you cannot speak,&rdquo; continued the general, &ldquo;will you trust me
      with the letters themselves? Have you brought them to town with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The original letters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, those in the packet which I gave to you at Clarendon Park.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are burned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All?&mdash;one, this first letter I saw you tear; did you burn all the
      rest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are burned,&rdquo; repeated she, colouring all over. She could not say &ldquo;I
      burned them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He thought it a poor evasion. &ldquo;They are burned,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;that is,
      you burned them: unfortunate. I must then recur to my first appeal. Take
      this pencil, and mark, I pray you, the passages that are your&rsquo;s. I may be
      called on to prove the forgery of these passages: if you do not show me,
      and truly, which are yours, and which are not, how can I answer for you,
      Helen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One hour,&rdquo; said Helen,&mdash;&ldquo;only leave me for one hour, and it shall be
      done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why this cowardly delay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask only one hour&mdash;only leave me for one hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I obey, Miss Stanley, since it must be so. I am gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went, and Helen felt how sunk she was in his opinion,&mdash;sunk for
      ever, she feared! but she could not think distinctly, her mind was
      stunned; she felt that she must wait for somebody, but did not at first
      recollect clearly that it was for Cecilia. She leaned back on the sofa,
      and sank into a sort of dreamy state. How long she remained thus
      unconscious she knew not; but she was roused at last by the sound, as she
      fancied, of a carriage stopping at the door: she started up, but it was
      gone, or it had not been. She perceived that the breakfast things had been
      removed, and, turning her eyes upon the clock, she was surprised to see
      how late it was. She snatched up the pages which she hated to touch, and
      ran up-stairs to Cecilia&rsquo;s room,&mdash;door bolted;&mdash;she gave a hasty
      tap&mdash;no answer; another louder, no answer. She ran into the
      dressing-room for Felicie, who came with a face of mystery, and the smile
      triumphant of one who knows what is not to be known. But the smile
      vanished on seeing Miss Stanley&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bon Dieu! Miss Stanley&mdash;how pale! mais qu&rsquo;est ce que c&rsquo;est? Mon
      Dieu, qu&rsquo;est ce que c&rsquo;est donc?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s door bolted within side?&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, only lock by me,&rdquo; said Mademoiselle Felicie. &ldquo;Miladi charge me not to
      tell you she was not dere. And I had de presentiment you might go up to
      look for her in her room. Her head is got better quite. She is all up and
      dress; she is gone out in the carriage, and will soon be back no doubt. I
      know not to where she go, but in my opinion to my Lady Katrine. If you
      please, you not mention I say dat, as miladi charge me not to speak of dis
      to you. <i>Apparemment quelque petit mystère</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Helen felt as if her last hope was gone, and now in a contrary
      extreme from the dreamy torpor in which she had been before, she was
      seized with a nervous impatience for the arrival of Cecilia, though
      whether to hope or fear from it, she did not distinctly know. She went to
      the drawing-room, and listened and listened, and watched and watched, and
      looked at the clock, and felt a still increasing dread that the general
      might return before Lady Cecilia, and that she should not have
      accomplished her promise. She became more and more impatient. As it grew
      later, the rolling of carriages increased, and their noise grew louder,
      and continually as they came near she expected that one would stop at the
      door. She expected and expected, and feared, and grew sick with fear long
      deferred. At last one carriage did stop, and then came a thundering knock&mdash;louder,
      she thought, than usual; but before she could decide whether it was
      Cecilia or not, the room-door opened, and the servant had scarcely time to
      say, that two ladies who did not give their names had insisted upon being
      let up&mdash;when the two ladies entered. One in the extreme of foreign
      fashion, but an Englishwoman, of assured and not prepossessing appearance;
      the other, half hid behind her companion, and all timidity, struck Helen
      as the most beautiful creature she had ever beheld.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand pardons for forcing your doors,&rdquo; said the foremost lady; &ldquo;but
      I bear my apology in my hand: a precious little box of Roman cameos from a
      friend of Lady Cecilia Clarendon&rsquo;s, which I was desired to deliver
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen was, of course, sorry that Lady Cecilia was not at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume I have the honour of speaking to Miss Stanley,&rdquo; continued the
      assured lady, and she gave her card &ldquo;Comtesse de St. Cymon.&rdquo; Then
      half-turning to the beauty, who now became visible&mdash;&ldquo;Allow me to <i>mention</i>&mdash;Lady
      Blanche Forrester.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that name Helen did not start, but she felt as if she had received an
      electric shock. How she went through the necessary forms of civility she
      knew not; but even in the agony of passion the little habits of life hold
      their sway. The customary motions were made, and words pronounced; yet
      when Helen looked at that beautiful Lady Blanche, and saw how beautiful!
      there came a spasm at her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The comtesse, in answer to her look towards a chair, did not &ldquo;choose to
      sit down&mdash;could not stay&mdash;would not intrude on Miss Stanley.&rdquo; So
      they stood, Helen supporting herself as best she could, and preserving,
      apparently, perfect composure, seeming to listen to what farther Madame de
      St. Cymon was saying; but only the sounds reached her ear, and a general
      notion that she spoke of the box in her hand. She gave Helen some message
      to Lady Cecilia, explanatory of her waiting or not waiting upon her
      ladyship, to all which Helen answered with proper signs of civility; and
      while the comtesse was going on, she longed to look again at Lady Blanche,
      but dared not. She saw a half curtsey and a receding motion; and she knew
      they were going, and she curtsied mechanically. She felt inexpressible
      relief when Madame de St. Cymon turned her back and moved towards the
      door. Then Helen looked again at Lady Blanche, and saw again her
      surpassing beauty and perfect tranquillity. The tranquillity gave her
      courage, it passed instantaneously into herself, through her whole
      existence. The comtesse stopped in her way out, to look at a china table.
      &ldquo;Ha! beautiful! Sêvre!&mdash;enamel&mdash;by Jaquetot, is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen was able to go forward, and answer to all the questions asked. Not
      one word from the Lady Blanche; but she wished to hear the sound of her
      voice. She tried&mdash;she spoke to her; but to whatever Helen said, no
      answer came, but the sweetest of smiles. The comtesse, with easy assurance
      and impertinent ill-breeding, looked at all that lay in her way, and took
      up and opened the miniature pictures that were on the table. &ldquo;Lady Cecilia
      Clarendon&mdash;charming!&mdash;Blanche, you never saw her yet. Quite
      charming, is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not a word from Lady Blanche, but a smile, a Guido smile. Another
      miniature taken up by the curious comtesse. &ldquo;Ah! very like indeed! not
      flattered though. Do you know it, Blanche&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Beauclerc. Lady Blanche then murmured some few words indistinctly,
      in a very sweet voice, but showed no indication of feeling, except, as
      Helen gave one glance, she thought she saw a slight colour, like the
      inside of a shell, delicately beautiful; but it might be only the
      reflection from the crimson silk curtain near which she stood: it was
      gone, and the picture put down; and in a lively tone from the comtesse &ldquo;<i>Au
      revoir</i>,&rdquo; and exit, a graceful bend from the silent beauty, and the
      vision vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen stood for some moments fixed to the spot where they left her. She
      questioned her inmost thoughts. &ldquo;Why was I struck so much, so strangely,
      with that beauty&mdash;so painfully? It cannot be envy; I never was
      envious of any one, though so many I have seen so much handsomer than
      myself. Jealousy? surely not; for there is no reason for it&mdash;no
      possibility of danger. Yet now, alas! when he has so much cause to doubt
      me! perhaps he might change. He seemed so displeased last night, and he
      has never been here all the morning!&rdquo; She recollected the look and accent
      of Madame de St. Cymon, as she said the words &ldquo;<i>au revoir</i>.&rdquo; Helen
      did not like the words, or the look. She did not like anything about
      Madame de St. Cymon: &ldquo;Something so assured, so impertinent! And all that
      unintelligible message about those cameos!&mdash;a mere excuse for making
      this unseasonable pushing visit&mdash;just pushing for the acquaintance.
      The general will never permit it, though&mdash;that is one comfort. But
      why do I say comfort?&rdquo; Back went the circle of her thoughts to the same
      point.&mdash;&ldquo;What can I do?&mdash;the general will return, he will find I
      have not obeyed him. But what can be done till Cecilia returns? If she
      were but here, I could mark&mdash;we could settle. O Cecilia! where are
      you? But,&rdquo; thought she, &ldquo;I had better look at the whole. I will, have
      courage to read these horrible letters.&rdquo; To prevent all hazard of further
      interruption, she now went into an inner room, bolted the doors, and sat
      down to her dreaded task. And there we leave her.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      That Fortune is not nice in her morality, that she frequently favours
      those who do not adhere to truth more than those who do, we have early had
      occasion to observe. But whether Fortune may not be in this, as in all the
      rest, treacherous and capricious; whether she may not by her first smiles
      and favours lure her victims on to their cost, to their utter undoing at
      last, remains to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is time to inquire what has become of Lady Cecilia Clarendon. Before we
      follow her on her very early morning visit to her cousin&rsquo;s, we must take
      leave to pause one moment to remark, not in the way of moralising by any
      means, but simply as a matter of history, that the first little fib in
      which Lady Cecilia, as a customary licence of speech, indulged herself the
      moment she awoke this morning, though it seemed to answer its purpose
      exactly at the time, occasioned her ladyship a good deal of superfluous
      toil and trouble during the course of the day. In reply to the first
      question her husband had asked, or in evasion of that question, she had
      answered, &ldquo;My dear love, don&rsquo;t ask me any questions, for I have such a
      horrid headache, that I really can hardly speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now a headache, such as she had at that moment, certainly never silenced
      any woman. Slighter could not be&mdash;scarce enough to swear by. There
      seemed no great temptation to prevarication either, for the general&rsquo;s
      question was not of a formidable nature, not what the lawyers call a
      leading question, rather one that led to nothing. It was only, &ldquo;Had you a
      pleasant party at Lady Castlefort&rsquo;s last night, my dear Cecilia?&rdquo; But with
      that prescience with which some nicely foresee how the truth, seemingly
      most innocent, may do harm, her ladyship foreboded that, if she answered
      straight forward&mdash;&ldquo;no&rdquo;&mdash;that might lead to&mdash;why? how? or
      wherefore?&mdash;and this might bring out the history of the strange rude
      manner in which <i>la belle fiancée</i> had been received. That need not
      necessarily have followed, but, even if it had, it would have done her no
      harm,&mdash;rather would have served at once her purpose in the best
      manner possible, as time will show. Her husband, unsuspicious man, asked
      no more questions, and only gave her the very advice she wished him to
      give, that she should not get up to breakfast&mdash;that she should rest
      as long as she could. Farther, as if to forward her schemes, even without
      knowing them, he left the house early, and her headache conveniently going
      off, she was dressed with all despatch&mdash;carriage at the door as soon
      as husband out of sight, and away she went, as we have seen, without
      Helen&rsquo;s hearing, seeing, or suspecting her so well contrived and executed
      project.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was now in good spirits. The infection of fear which she had caught,
      perhaps from the too sensitive Helen, last night, she had thrown off this
      morning. It was a sunny day, and the bright sunshine dispelled, as ever
      with her, any black notions of the night, all melancholy ideas whatsoever.
      She had all the constitutional hopefulness of good animal spirits. But
      though no fears remained, curiosity was as strong as ever. She was
      exceedingly eager to know what had been the cause of all these strange
      appearances. She guessed it must be some pitiful jealousy of Lady
      Katrine&rsquo;s&mdash;some poor spite against Helen. Anything that should really
      give Beauclerc uneasiness, she now sincerely believed to be out of the
      question. Nonsense&mdash;only Helen and Beauclerc&rsquo;s love of tormenting
      themselves&mdash;quite nonsense! And nonsense! three times ejaculated,
      quite settled the matter, and assured her in the belief that there could
      be nothing serious to be apprehended. In five minutes she should be at the
      bottom of all things, and in half an hour return triumphant to Helen, and
      make her laugh at her cowardly self. The carriage rolled on, Lady
      Cecilia&rsquo;s spirits rising as she moved rapidly onwards, so that by the time
      she arrived at Lady Castlefort&rsquo;s she was not only in good but in high
      spirits. To her askings, &ldquo;Not at home&rdquo; never echoed. Even at hours undue,
      such as the present, she, privileged, penetrated. Accordingly,
      unquestioned, unquestioning, the alert step was let down, opened wide was
      the hall-door, and lightly tripped she up the steps; but the first look
      into the hall told her that company was in the house already&mdash;yes&mdash;a
      breakfast&mdash;all were in the breakfast-room, except Lady Castlefort,
      not yet come down&mdash;above, the footman believed, in her boudoir. To
      the boudoir Cecilia went, but Lady Castlefort was not there, and Cecilia
      was surprised to hear the sound of music in the drawing-room, Lady
      Castlefort&rsquo;s voice singing. While she waited in the next room for the song
      to be finished, Cecilia turned over the books on the table, richly gilt
      and beautifully bound, except one in a brown paper parcel, which seemed
      unsuited to the table, yet excited more attention than all the others,
      because it was directed <i>&ldquo;Private&mdash;for Lady Katherine Hawksby&mdash;to
      be returned before two o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</i> What could it be? thought Lady
      Cecilia. But her attention was now attracted by the song which Lady
      Castlefort seemed to be practising; the words were distinctly pronounced,
      uncommonly distinctly, so as to be plainly heard&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> &ldquo;Had we never loved so kindly,<br />  Hail we never loved so blindly,<br />  Never met, or never parted.<br />  We had ne&rsquo;er been broken-hearted."<br /></pre>
    <p>
      As Cecilia listened, she cast her eyes upon a card which lay on the table&mdash;&ldquo;Lord
      Beltravers,&rdquo; and a new light flashed upon her, a light favourable to her
      present purpose; for since the object was altered with Lady Castlefort,
      since it was not Beauclerc any longer, there would be no further ill-will
      towards Helen. Lady Castlefort was not of the violent vindictive sort,
      with her there was no long-lasting <i>dépit amoureux</i>. She was not that
      fury, a woman scorned, but that blessed spirit, a woman believing herself
      always admired. &ldquo;Soft, silly, sooth&mdash;not one of the hard, wicked, is
      Louisa,&rdquo; thought Cecilia. And as Lady Castlefort, slowly opening the door,
      entered, timid, as if she knew some particular person was in the room,
      Cecilia could not help suspecting that Louisa had intended her song for
      other ears than those of her dear cousin, and that the superb negligence
      of her dress was not unstudied; but that well-prepared, well-according
      sentimental air, changed instantly on seeing&mdash;not the person
      expected, and with a start, she exclaimed, &ldquo;Cecilia Clarendon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Louisa Castlefort!&rdquo; cried Lady Cecilia, answering that involuntary start
      of confusion with a well-acted start of admiration. &ldquo;Louisa Castlefort, <i>si
      belle, si belle</i>, so beautifully dressed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beautifully dressed&mdash;nothing extraordinary!&rdquo; said Lady Castlefort,
      advancing with a half embarrassed, half <i>nonchalant</i> air,&mdash;&ldquo;One
      must make something of a <i>toilette de matin</i>, you know, when one has
      people to breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So elegant, so negligent!&rdquo; continued Lady Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is the point,&rdquo; said Lady Castlefort. &ldquo;I cannot bear any thing that
      is studied in costume, for dress is really a matter of so little
      consequence! I never bestow a thought upon it. Angelique rules my toilette
      as she pleases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Angelique has the taste of an angel fresh from Paris,&rdquo; cried Lady
      Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now tell me, Cecilia,&rdquo; pursued Lady Castlefort, quite in good humour,
      &ldquo;tell me, my dear, to what do I owe this pleasure? what makes you so <i>matinale?</i>
      It must be something very extraordinary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, only a little matter of curiosity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, from Lady Castlefort, who had hitherto, as if in absence of mind,
      stood, there was a slight &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you sit?&rdquo; motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, I can&rsquo;t sit, can&rsquo;t stay,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      A look quickly visible, and quickly suppressed, showed Lady Castlefort&rsquo;s
      sense of relief; then came immediately greater pressing to sit down, &ldquo;Pray
      do not be in such a hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am keeping you; have you breakfasted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Taken coffee in my own room,&rdquo; said Lady Castlefort &ldquo;But you have people
      to breakfast; must not you go down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, I shall not go down for this is Katrine&rsquo;s affair, as I will
      explain to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia was quite content, without any explanation; and sitting down,
      she drew her chair close to Lady Castlefort, and said, &ldquo;Now, my dear, my
      little matter of curiosity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay, my dear, first I must tell you about Katrine&mdash;now
      confidentially&mdash;very.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia ought to have been aware that when once her dear cousin
      Louisa&rsquo;s little heart opened, and she became confidential, very, it was
      always of her own domestic grievances she began to talk, and that, once
      the sluice opened, out poured from the deep reservoir the long-collected
      minute drops of months and years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no idea what a life I lead with Katrine&mdash;now she is grown
      blue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she?&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia, quite indifferent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deep blue! shocking: and this is a blue breakfast, and all the people at
      it are true bores, and a blue bore is, as Horace Churchill says, one of
      the most mischievous creatures breathing; and he tells me the only way of
      hindering them from doing mischief is by <i>ringing</i> them; but first
      you must get rings. Now, in this case, for Katrine not a ring to be had
      for love or money. So there is no hope for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No hope for me,&rdquo; thought Lady Cecilia, throwing herself back in her
      chair, submissive, but not resigned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it had but pleased Heaven,&rdquo; continued Lady Castlefort, &ldquo;in its mercy,
      to have sent Katrine a husband of any kind, what a blessing it would have
      been! If she could but have been married to any body&mdash;now any body&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any body is infinitely obliged to you,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;but since that is
      out of the question, let us say no more about it&mdash;no use.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No use! that is the very thing of which I complain; the very thing which
      must ever&mdash;ever make me miserable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, my dear,&rdquo; cried Lady Cecilia, no longer capable of patience;
      &ldquo;do not be miserable any more just now; never mind Katrine just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind her! Easy for you to say, Cecilia, who do not live with
      Katrine Hawksby, and do not know what it is to have such a plague of a
      sister, watching one,&mdash;watching every turn, every look one gives&mdash;worse
      than a jealous husband. Can I say more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; cried Cecilia; &ldquo;therefore say no more about it. I understand it all
      perfectly, and I pity you from the bottom of my heart, so now, my dear
      Louisa&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, my dear Cecilia,&rdquo; pursued Lady Castlefort, continuing her own
      thoughts, &ldquo;I tell you, Katrine is envious of me. Envy has been her fault
      from a child. Envy of poor me! Envy, in the first place, of whatever good
      looks it pleased Providence to give me.&rdquo; A glance at the glass.&mdash;&ldquo;And
      now Katrine envies me for being Lady Castlefort, Heaven knows! now,
      Cecilia, and you know, she need not envy me so when she looks at Lord
      Castlefort; that is, what she sometimes says herself, which you know is
      very wrong of her to say to me&mdash;unnecessary too, when she knows I had
      no more hand in my marriage&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Than heart!&rdquo; Cecilia could not forbear saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Than heart!&rdquo; readily responded Lady Castlefort; &ldquo;never was a truer word
      said. Never was there a more complete sacrifice than my mother made of me;
      you know, Cecilia, a poor, young, innocent, helpless sacrifice, if ever
      there was one upon earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To a coronet,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely dragged to the altar,&rdquo; continued Lady Castlefort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Mechlin lace, that was some comfort,&rdquo; said Cecilia laughing, and she
      laughed on in hope of cutting short this sad chapter of sacrifices. But
      Lady Castlefort did not understand raillery upon this too tender point. &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t know what you mean by Mechlin lace,&rdquo; cried she pettishly. &ldquo;Is this
      your friendship for me, Cecilia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia, justly in fear of losing the reward of all her large lay-out of
      flattery, fell to protesting the tenderest sympathy. &ldquo;But only now it was
      all over, why make her heart bleed about what could not be helped?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cannot be helped! Oh! there is the very thing I must ever, ever mourn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The embroidered cambric handkerchief was taken out of the bag; no tears,
      indeed, came, but there were sobs, and Cecilia not knowing how far it
      might go, apprehending that her ladyship meditated hysterics, seized a
      smelling-bottle, threw out the stopper, and presented it close under the
      nostrils. The good &ldquo;<i>Sels poignans d&rsquo;Angleterre,</i>&rdquo; of which Felicie
      always acknowledged the unrivalled potency, did their business
      effectually. Back went the head, with an exclamation of &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough!
      Oh, oh! too much! too much, Cecilia!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you better, my dear?&rdquo; inquired Cecilia; &ldquo;but indeed you must not give
      way to low spirits; indeed, you must not: so now to change the
      conversation, Louisa&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so fast, Lady Cecilia; not yet;&rdquo; and now Louisa went on with a
      medical maundering. &ldquo;As to low spirits, my dear Cecilia, I must say I
      agree with Sir Sib Pennyfeather, who tells me it is not mere common low
      spirits, but really all mind, too much mind; mind preying upon my nerves.
      Oh! I knew it myself. At first he thought it was rather constitutional;
      poor dear Sir Sib! he is very clever, Sir Sib; and I convinced him he was
      wrong; and so we agreed that it was all upon my mind&mdash;all; all&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that instant a green parrot, who had been half asleep in the corner,
      awoke on Lady Castlefort&rsquo;s pronouncing, in an elevated tone, &ldquo;All, all!&rdquo;
       and conceiving himself in some way called upon, answered, &ldquo;Poll! Poll! bit
      o&rsquo;sugar Poll!&rdquo; No small difficulty had Lady Cecilia at that moment in
      keeping her risible muscles in order; but she did, for Helen&rsquo;s sake, and
      she was rewarded, for after Lady Castlefort had, all unconscious of
      ridicule, fed Poll from her amber bonbonniere, and sighed out once more
      &ldquo;Mind! too much mind!&rdquo; she turned to Cecilia, and said, &ldquo;But, my dear, you
      wanted something; you had something to ask me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At once, and as fast as she could speak, Lady Cecilia poured out her
      business about Helen Stanley. She told of the ill-bred manner in which
      Helen had been received last night; inquired why the words <i>promessi
      sposi</i> and <i>belle fiancée</i> were so oddly repeated, as if they had
      been watchwords, and asked what was meant by all those strange whisperings
      in the sanctum sanctorum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Katrine&rsquo;s set,&rdquo; observed Lady Castlefort coolly. &ldquo;Just like them; just
      like her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not care about it in the least,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia, &ldquo;if it were
      only Katrine&rsquo;s ill-nature, or their ill-breeding. Ill-breeding always
      recoils on the ill-bred, and does nobody else any harm. But I should be
      glad to be quite clear that there is nothing more at the bottom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Castlefort made no reply, but took up a bunch of seals, and looked at
      each of them one after another. Lady Cecilia more afraid now than she had
      yet been that there was something at the bottom, still bravely went on,
      &ldquo;What is it? If you know, tell me at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, ask Katrine,&rdquo; said Lady Castlefort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I ask you, I would rather ask you, for you are good-natured, Louisa&mdash;so
      tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I dare say it is only slander,&rdquo; said the good-natured Louisa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Slander!&rdquo; repeated Lady Cecilia, &ldquo;slander did you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; what is there to surprise you so much in that word? did you never
      hear of such a thing? I am sure I hear too much of it; Katrine lives and
      breathes and fattens upon it; as Churchill says, she eats slander, drinks
      slander, sleeps upon slander.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But tell me, what of Helen? that is all I want to hear,&rdquo; cried Lady
      Cecilia: &ldquo;Slander! of Helen Stanley! what is it that Katrine says about
      poor Helen? what spite, what vengeance, can she have against her, tell me,
      tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you would ask one question at a time, I might be able to answer you,&rdquo;
       said Lady Castlefort. &ldquo;Do not hurry me so; you fidget my nerves. First as
      to the spite, you know yourself that Katrine, from the beginning, never
      could endure Helen Stanley; for my part, I always rather liked her than
      otherwise, and shall defend her to the last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Defend her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Katrine was always jealous of her, and lately worse than ever, for
      getting into her place, as she says, with you; that made her hate her all
      the more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let her hate on, that will never make me love Helen the less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I told her; and besides, Miss Stanley is going to be married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure;&mdash;well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Katrine naturally hates every body that is going to be married. If
      you were to see the state she is in always reading the announcements of
      Marriages in High Life! Churchill, I do believe, had Miss Stanley&rsquo;s
      intended match put into every paper continually, on purpose for the
      pleasure of plaguing Katrine; and if you could have seen her long face,
      when she saw it announced in the Court Gazette&mdash;good authority, you
      know&mdash;really it was pitiable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care, I don&rsquo;t care about that&mdash;Oh pray go on to the facts
      about Helen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but the fact is as I tell you; you wanted to know what sufficient
      cause for vengeance, and am not I telling you? If you would not get into
      such a state of excitement!&mdash;as Sir Sib says excitements should be
      avoided. La! my dear,&rdquo; continued Lady Castlefort, looking up at her with
      unfeigned astonishment, &ldquo;what agitation! why, if it were a matter that
      concerned yourself&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It concerns my friend, and that is the same thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So one says; but&mdash;you look really, such a colour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter what colour I look,&rdquo; cried Cecilia; &ldquo;go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you never read the papers?&rdquo; said Lady Castlefort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia; &ldquo;but I have not looked at a paper these
      three days; was there any thing particular? tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear! tell you! as if I could remember by heart all the scandalous
      paragraphs I read.&rdquo; She looked round the room, and not seeing the papers,
      said, &ldquo;I do not know what has become of those papers; but you can find
      them when you go home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She mentioned the names of two papers, noted for being personal,
      scandalous, and scurrilous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are those the papers you mean?&rdquo; cried Lady Cecilia; &ldquo;the general never
      lets them into the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a pity&mdash;that&rsquo;s hard upon you, for then you never are, as you
      see, <i>au courant du jour</i>, and all your friends might be abused to
      death without your knowing it, if some kind person did not tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do tell me, then, the substance; I don&rsquo;t want the words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the words are all. Somehow it is nothing without the words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In her now excited state of communicativeness, Lady Castlefort rose and
      looked all about the room for the papers, saying, &ldquo;They were here, they
      were there, all yesterday; Katrine had them showing them to Lady Masham in
      the morning, and to all her blue set afterwards&mdash;Lord knows what she
      has done with them. So tiresome looking for things! how I hate it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rang the bell and inquired from the footman if he knew what had become
      of the papers. Of course he did not know, could not imagine&mdash;servants
      never know, nor can imagine what have become of newspapers&mdash;but he
      would inquire. While he went to inquire, Lady Castlefort sank down again
      into her <i>bergère</i>, and again fell into admiration of Cecilia&rsquo;s state
      of impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How curious you are! Now I am never really curious about any thing that
      does not come home to myself; I have so little interest about other
      people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was said in all the simplicity of selfishness, not from candour, but
      from mere absence of shame, and utter ignorance of what others think&mdash;what
      others feel, which always characterises, and often betrays the selfish,
      even where the head is best capable of supplying the deficiencies of the
      heart. But Louisa Castlefort had no head to hide her want of heart; while
      Cecilia, who had both head and heart, looked down upon her cousin with
      surprise, pity, and contempt, quick succeeding each other, in a sort of
      parenthesis of feeling, as she moved her eyes for a moment from the door
      on which they had been fixed, and to which they recurred, while she stood
      waiting for the appearance of those newspapers. The footman entered with
      them. &ldquo;In Mr. Landrum&rsquo;s room they were, my lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia did not hear a word that was said, nor did she see that the
      servant laid a note on the table. It was well that Louisa had that note to
      read, and to answer, while Cecilia looked at the paragraphs in these
      papers; else her start must have been seen, her exclamation must have been
      heard: it must have been marked, that the whole character of her emotion
      changed from generous sympathy with her friend, to agony of fear for
      herself. The instant she cast her eyes on that much-read paper, she saw
      the name of Colonel D&rsquo;Aubigny; all the rest swam before her eyes. Lady
      Castlefort, without looking up from her writing, asked&mdash;What day of
      the month? Cecilia could not answer, but recalled to herself by the sound
      of the voice, she now tried to read&mdash;she scarcely read the words, but
      some way took the sense into her mind at a glance.

      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The first of these paragraphs caught the eye by its title in capital
      letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;LA BELLE FIANCÉE.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though quite unknown in the London world, this young lady cannot fail to
      excite some curiosity among our fashionables as the successful rival of
      one whom the greatest painter of the age has pronounced to be <i>the
      fairest of the fair</i>&mdash;the Lady B. F. This new <i>Helen</i> is, we
      understand, of a respectable family, niece to a late dean, distinguished
      for piety much and virtù more. It was reported that the niece was a great
      heiress, but after the proposal had been made, it was discovered that
      Virtù had made away with every shilling of her fortune. This made no
      difference in the eyes of her inamorato, who is as rich as he is generous,
      and who saw with the eyes of a youth &lsquo;Of Age to-morrow.&rsquo; His guardian, a
      wary general, demurred&mdash;but <i>nursery tactics</i> prevailed. The
      young lady, though she had never been out, bore the victory from him of
      many campaigns. The day for the marriage was fixed as announced by us&mdash;But
      we are concerned to state that a <i>postponement</i> of this marriage for
      <i>mysterious reasons</i> has taken place. Delicacy forbids us to say more
      at present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Delicacy, however, did not prevent their saying in the next paper in a
      paragraph headed, &ldquo;MYSTERY SOLVED,&rdquo; &ldquo;We understand that in the course of a
      few days will appear the &lsquo;Memoirs of the late Colonel D&mdash;&mdash;y;
      or, <i>Reminiscences of a Rouè</i>, well known in the Fashionable World.&rsquo; 
      This little volume bids fair to engross the attention of the higher
      circles, as it contains, besides innumerable curious, personal, and secret
      anecdotes, the original love letters of a certain <i>belle fiancée</i>,
      now residing with a noble family in Grosvenor Square.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia saw at once the whole dreadful danger&mdash;her own letters
      to Colonel D&rsquo;Aubigny they must he! How could they have got them? They
      would be seen by her husband&mdash;published to the whole world&mdash;if
      the general found out they were hers, he would cast her off for ever. If
      they were believed to be Helen&rsquo;s&mdash;Helen was undone, sacrificed to her
      folly, her cowardice. &ldquo;Oh! if I had but told Clarendon, he would have
      stopped this dreadful, dreadful publication.&rdquo; And what falsehoods it might
      contain, she did not even dare to think. All was remorse, terror,
      confusion&mdash;fixed to the spot like one stupified, she stood. Lady
      Castlefort did not see it&mdash;she had been completely engrossed with
      what she had been writing, she was now looking for her most sentimental
      seal, and not till she had pressed that seal down and examined the
      impression, did she look up or notice Cecilia&mdash;Then struck indeed
      with a sense of something unusual&mdash;&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you have no
      idea how odd you look&mdash;so strange, Cecilia&mdash;quite <i>èbahie!</i>&rdquo;
       Giving two pulls to the bell as she spoke, and her eyes on the door,
      impatient for the servant, she added&mdash;&ldquo;After all, Cecilia, Helen
      Stanley is no relation even&mdash;only a friend. Take this note&mdash;&rdquo; to
      the footman who answered the bell; and the moment he left the room,
      continuing, in the same tone, to Lady Cecilia, she said&mdash;&ldquo;You will
      have to give her up at last&mdash;that&rsquo;s all; so you had better make your
      mind up to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Lady Cecilia tried to speak, she felt her tongue cleave to the roof
      of her mouth; and when she did articulate, it was in a sort of hoarse
      sound. &ldquo;Is the book published?&rdquo; She held the paper before Lady
      Castlefort&rsquo;s eyes, and pointed to the name she could not utter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&rsquo;Aubigny&rsquo;s book&mdash;is it published, do you mean?&rdquo; said Lady
      Castlefort. &ldquo;Absolutely published, I cannot say, but it is all in print, I
      know. I do not understand about publishing. There&rsquo;s something about
      presentation copies: I know Katrine was wild to have one before any body
      else, so she is to have the first copy, I know, and, I believe, is to have
      it this very morning for the people at this breakfast: it is to be the <i>bonne
      bouche</i> of the business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has Katrine to do with it?&mdash;Oh, tell me, quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me, Cecilia, what a fuss you are in!&mdash;you make me quite nervous
      to look at you. You had better go down to the breakfast-room, and you will
      hear all about it from the fountain-head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Katrine the book or not?&rdquo; cried Lady Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me! I will inquire, my dear, if you will not look so dreadful.&rdquo; She
      rang and coolly asked&mdash;&ldquo;Did that man, that bookseller, Stone, send
      any parcel or book this morning, do you know, for Lady Katrine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my lady; Landrum had a parcel for Lady Katrine&mdash;it is on the
      table, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo; The man left the room. Lady Cecilia darted on the brown paper
      parcel she had seen directed to Lady Katrine, and seized it before the
      amazed Louisa could prevent her. &ldquo;Stop, stop!&rdquo; cried she, springing
      forward, &ldquo;stop, Cecilia; Katrine will never forgive me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Lady Cecilia seizing a penknife, cut the first knot. &ldquo;Oh, Cecilia, I
      am undone if Katrine comes in! Make haste, make haste! I can only let you
      have a peep or two. We must do it up again as well as ever,&rdquo; continued
      Lady Castlefort, while Lady Cecilia, fast as possible, went on cut, cut,
      cutting the packthread to bits, and she tore off the brown paper cover,
      then one of silver paper, that protected the silk binding. Lady Castlefort
      took up the outer cover and read, &ldquo;To be returned before two o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;What
      can that mean? Then it is only lent; not her own. Katrine will not
      understand this&mdash;will be outrageously disappointed. I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t
      care. But here is a note from Stone, however, which may explain it.&rdquo; She
      opened and read&mdash;&ldquo;Stone&rsquo;s respects&mdash;existing circumstances make
      it necessary her ladyship&rsquo;s copy should be returned. Will be called for at
      two o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cecilia, Cecilia, make haste! But Katrine does not know yet&mdash;Still
      she may come up.&rdquo; Lady Castlefort rang and inquired,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have they done breakfast?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Breakfast is over, my lady,&rdquo; said the servant who answered the bell, &ldquo;but
      Landrum thinks the gentlemen and ladies will not be up immediately, on
      account of one of the ladies being <i>performing</i> a poem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, very good,&rdquo; added her ladyship, as the man left the room.
      &ldquo;Then, Cecilia, you will have time enough, for when once they begin
      performing, as Sylvester calls it, there is no end of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh Heavens!&rdquo; cried Cecilia, as she turned over the pages, &ldquo;Oh Heavens!
      what is here? Such absolute falsehood! Shocking, shocking!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
      as she looked on, terrified at what she saw: &ldquo;Absolutely false&mdash;a
      forgery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whereabouts are you?&rdquo; said Lady Castlefort, approaching to read along
      with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do not read it,&rdquo; cried Cecilia, and she hastily closed the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What signifies shutting the book, my dear,&rdquo; said Louisa, &ldquo;as if you could
      shut people&rsquo;s eyes? I know what it is; I have read it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read it! I really can read, though it seems to astonish you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is not published?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One can read in manuscript.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did you see the manuscript?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a glimpse. Yes&mdash;I know more than Katrine thinks I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O tell me, Louisa; tell me all,&rdquo; cried Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, but you must never tell that I told it to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak, speak,&rdquo; cried Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a long story,&rdquo; said Lady Castlefort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make it short then. O tell me quick, Louisa.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a literary <i>dessous des cartes</i>,&rdquo; said Lady Castlefort, a
      little vain of knowing a literary <i>dessous des cartes</i>; &ldquo;Churchill
      being at the head of every thing of that sort, you know, the bookseller
      brought him the manuscript which Sir Thomas D&rsquo;Aubigny had offered him, and
      wanted to know whether it would do or not. Mr. Churchill&rsquo;s answer was,
      that it would never do without more pepper and salt, meaning gossip and
      scandal, and all that. But you are reading on, Cecilia, not listening to
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am listening, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then never tell how I came to know every thing. Katrine&rsquo;s maid has a
      lover, who is, as she phrases it, one of the gentlemen connected with the
      press. Now, my Angelique, who cannot endure Katrine&rsquo;s maid, tells me that
      this man is only a <i>wonder-maker</i>, a half-crown paragraph writer. So,
      through Angelique, and indeed from another person&mdash;&rdquo; she stopped; and
      then went on&mdash;&ldquo;through Angelique it all came up to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All what?&rdquo; cried Cecilia; &ldquo;go on, go on to the facts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, if you will not hurry me so. The letters were not in Miss
      Stanley&rsquo;s handwriting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! I am sure of that,&rdquo; said Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Copies were all that they pretended to be; so they may be forgeries after
      all, you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how did Katrine or Mr. Churchill come by the copies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a notion, but of this I am not quite sure&mdash;I have a notion,
      from something I was told by&mdash;in short I suspect that Carlos, Lady
      Davenant&rsquo;s page, somehow got at them, and gave them, or had them given to
      the man who was to publish the book. Lady Katrine and Churchill laid their
      heads together; here, in this very <i>sanctum sanctorum</i>. They thought
      I knew nothing, but I knew every thing. I do not believe Horace had
      anything to do with it, except saying that the love-letters would be just
      the thing for the public if they were bad enough. I remember, too, that it
      was he who added the second title, &lsquo;Reminiscences of a Rouè,&rsquo; and said
      something about alliteration&rsquo;s artful aid. And now,&rdquo; concluded Lady
      Castlefort, &ldquo;it is coming to the grand catastrophe, as Katrine calls it.
      She has already told the story, and to-day she was to give all her set
      what she calls ocular demonstration. Cecilia, now, quick, finish; they
      will be here this instant. Give me the book; let me do it up this minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; let me put it up,&rdquo; cried Lady Cecilia, keeping possession of the
      book and the brown paper. &ldquo;I am a famous hand at doing up a parcel, as
      famous as any Bond Street shopman: your hands are not made for such work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Any body but Lady Castlefort would have discerned that Lady Cecilia had
      some further design, and she was herself afraid it would be perceived; but
      taking courage from seeing what a fool she had to deal with, Lady Cecilia
      went on more boldly: &ldquo;Louisa, I must have more packthread; this is all cut
      to bits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will ring and ask for some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; do not ring for the footman; he might observe that we had opened
      the parcel. Cannot you get a string without ringing? Look in that basket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None there, I know,&rdquo; said Lady Castlefort without stirring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In your own room then; Angelique has some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know! never mind how. Go, and she will give you packthread. I must have
      it before Katrine comes up. So go, Louisa, go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go,&rdquo; in the imperative mood, operated, and she went; she did not know
      why.
    </p>
    <p>
      That instant Lady Cecilia drew the book out of the half-folded paper, and
      quick, quick, tore out page after page&mdash;every page of those letters
      that concerned herself or Helen, and into the fire thrust them, and as
      they blazed held them down bravely&mdash;had the boldness to wait till all
      was black: all the while she trembled, but stood it, and they were burnt,
      and the book in its brown paper cover was left on the table, and she down
      stairs, before Lady Castlefort&rsquo;s dressing-room door opened, and she
      crossed the hall without meeting a soul except the man in waiting there.
      The breakfast-room was at the back of the house looking into the gardens,
      and her carriage at the front-door had never been seen by Lady Katrine, or
      any of her blue set. She cleared out of the house into her carriage&mdash;and
      off&mdash;&ldquo;To the Park,&rdquo; said she.&mdash;She was off but just in time. The
      whole tribe came out of the breakfast room before she had turned the
      corner of the street. She threw herself back in the carriage and took
      breath, congratulating herself upon this hairbreadth &lsquo;scape. For this
      hour, this minute, she had escaped!&mdash;she was reprieved!
    </p>
    <p>
      And now what was next to be done? This was but a momentary reprieve.
      Another copy would be had&mdash;no, not till to-morrow though. The sound
      of the words that had been read from the bookseller&rsquo;s note by Lady
      Castlefort, though scarcely noticed at the time, recurred to her now; and
      there was hope something might to-day be done to prevent the publication.
      It might still be kept for ever from her husband&rsquo;s and from Beauclerc&rsquo;s
      knowledge. One stratagem had succeeded&mdash;others might.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took a drive round the Park to compose the excessive flurry of her
      spirits. Letting down all the glasses, she had the fresh air blowing upon
      her, and ere she was half round, she was able to think of what yet
      remained to do. Money! Oh! any money she could command she would give to
      prevent this publication. She was not known to the bookseller&mdash;no
      matter. Money is money from whatever hand. She would trust the matter to
      no one but herself, and she would go immediately&mdash;not a moment to be
      lost.&mdash;&ldquo;To Stone&rsquo;s, the bookseller&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arrived. &ldquo;Do not give my name; only say, a lady wants to speak to Mr.
      Stone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The people at Mr. Stone&rsquo;s did not know the livery or the carriage, but
      such a carriage and such a lady commanded the deference of the shopman.
      &ldquo;Please to walk in, madam,&rdquo; and by the time she had walked in, the man
      changed madam into your ladyship&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Stone will be with your
      ladyship in a moment&mdash;only in the warehouse. If your ladyship will
      please to walk up into the back drawing-room&mdash;there&rsquo;s a fire.&rdquo; The
      maid followed to blow it; and while the bellows wheezed and the fire did
      not burn, Lady Cecilia looked out of the window in eager expectation of
      seeing Mr. Stone returning from the warehouse with all due celerity. No
      Mr. Stone, however, appeared; but there was a good fire in the middle of
      the court-yard, as she observed to the maid who was plying the wheezing
      bellows; and who answered that they had had a great fire there this hour
      past &ldquo;burning of papers.&rdquo; And at that moment a man came out with his arms
      full of a huge pile&mdash;sheets of a book, Lady Cecilia saw&mdash;it was
      thrown on the fire. Then came out and stood before the fire&mdash;could
      she he mistaken?&mdash;impossible&mdash;it was like a dream&mdash;the
      general!
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia&rsquo;s first thought was to run away before she should be seen; but the
      next moment that thought was abandoned, for the time to execute it was now
      past. The messenger sent across the yard had announced that a lady in the
      back drawing-room wanted Mr. Stone. Eyes had looked up&mdash;the general
      had seen and recognised her, and all she could now do was, to recognise
      him in return, which she did as eagerly and gracefully as possible. The
      general came up to her directly, not a little astonished that she, whom he
      fancied at home in her bed, incapacitated by a headache that had prevented
      her from speaking to him, should be here, so far out of her usual haunts,
      and, as it seemed, out of her element&mdash;&ldquo;What can bring you here, my
      dear Cecilia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same purpose which, if I rightly spell, brought you here, my dear
      general,&rdquo; and her eye intelligently glanced at the burning papers in the
      yard. &ldquo;Do you know then, Cecilia, what those papers are? How did you
      know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia told her history, keeping as strictly to facts as the nature
      of the case admitted. Her headache, of course, she had found much better
      for the sleep she had taken. She had set off, she told him, as soon as she
      was able, for Lady Castlefort&rsquo;s, to inquire into the meaning of the
      strange whispers of the preceding night. Then she told of the scandalous
      paragraphs she had seen; how she had looked over the book; and how
      successfully she had torn out and destroyed the whole chapter; and then
      how, hoping to be able to prevent the publication, she had driven directly
      to Mr. Stone&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband, with confiding, admiring eyes, looked at her and listened to
      her, and thought all she said so natural, so kind, that he could not but
      love her the more for her zeal of friendship, though he blamed her for
      interfering, in defiance of his caution, &ldquo;Had you consulted me, or
      listened to me, my dear Cecilia, this morning, I could have saved you all
      this trouble; I should have told you that I would settle with Stone, and
      stop the publication, as I have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that copy which had been sent to Lady Katrine, surely I did some good
      there by burning those pages; for if once it had got among her set, it
      would have spread like wildfire, you know, Clarendon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He acknowledged this, and said, smiling&mdash;&ldquo;Be satisfied with yourself,
      my love; I acknowledge that you made there a capital <i>coup de main</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then in came Mr. Stone with an account in his hand, which the general
      stepped forward to receive, and, after one glance at the amount, he took
      up a pen, wrote, and signed his name to a cheque on his banker. Mr. Stone
      received it, bowed obsequiously, and assured the general that every copy
      of the offensive chapter had been withdrawn from the book and burnt&mdash;&ldquo;that
      copy excepted which you have yourself, general, and that which was sent to
      Lady Katrine Hawksby, which we expect in every minute, and it shall be
      sent to Grosvenor Square immediately. I will bring it myself, to prevent
      all danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general, who knew there was no danger there, smiled at Cecilia, and
      told the bookseller that he need take no further trouble about Lady
      Katrine&rsquo;s copy; the man bowed, and looking again at the amount of the
      cheque, retired well satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You come home with me, my dear Clarendon, do not you?&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      They drove off. On their way, the general said&mdash;&ldquo;It is always
      difficult to decide whether to contradict or to let such publications take
      their course: but in the present case, to stop the scandal instantly and
      completely was the only thing to be done. There are cases of honour, when
      women are concerned, where law is too slow: it must not be remedy, it must
      be prevention. If the finger of scorn dares to point, it must be&mdash;cut
      off.&rdquo; After a pause of grave thought, he added&mdash;&ldquo;Upon the manner in
      which Helen now acts will depend her happiness&mdash;her character&mdash;her
      whole future life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia summoned all her power to prevent her from betraying herself:
      the danger was great, for she could not command her fears so completely as
      to hide the look of alarm with which she listened to the general; but in
      his eyes her agitation appeared no more than was natural for her to feel
      about her friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My love,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;if Helen is worthy of your affection, she will
      show it now. Her only resource is in perfect truth: tell her so, Cecilia&mdash;impress
      it upon her mind. Would to Heaven I had been able to convince her of this
      at first! Speak to her strongly, Cecilia; as you love her, impress upon
      her that my esteem, Beauclerc&rsquo;s love, the happiness of her life, depend
      upon her truth!&rdquo; As he repeated these words, the carriage stopped at their
      own door.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      We left Helen in the back drawing-room, the door bolted, and beginning to
      read her dreaded task. The paragraphs in the newspapers, we have seen,
      were sufficiently painful, but when she came to the book itself&mdash;to
      the letters&mdash;she was in consternation, greater even than what she had
      felt in the general&rsquo;s presence under the immediate urgency of his eye and
      voice. Her conviction was that in each of these letters, there were some
      passages, some expressions, which certainly were Cecilia&rsquo;s, but mixed with
      others, which as certainly were not hers. The internal evidence appeared
      to her irresistibly strong: and even in those passages which she knew to
      be Cecilia&rsquo;s writing, it too plainly appeared that, however playfully,
      however delicately expressed, there was more of real attachment for
      Colonel D&rsquo;Aubigny than Cecilia had ever allowed Helen to believe; and she
      felt that Cecilia must shrink from General Clarendon&rsquo;s seeing these as her
      letters, after she had herself assured him that he was her first love. The
      falsehood was here so indubitable, so proved, that Helen herself trembled
      at the thought of Cecilia&rsquo;s acknowledging the plain facts to her husband.
      The time for it was past. Now that they were in print, published perhaps,
      how must he feel! If even candid confession were made to him, and made for
      the best motives, it would to him appear only forced by necessity&mdash;forced,
      as he would say to himself, because her friend would not submit to be
      sacrificed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were Helen&rsquo;s thoughts on reading the two or three first letters, but,
      as she went on, her alarm increased to horror. She saw things which she
      felt certain Cecilia could never have written; yet truth and falsehood
      were so mixed up in every paragraph, circumstances which she herself had
      witnessed so misrepresented, that it was all to her inextricable
      confusion. The passages which were to be marked could not now depend upon
      her opinion, her belief; they must rest upon Cecilia s integrity&mdash;and
      could she depend upon it? The impatience which she had felt for Lady
      Cecilia&rsquo;s return now faded away, and merged in the more painful thought
      that, when she did come, the suspense would not end&mdash;the doubts would
      never be satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lay down upon the sofa and tried to rest, kept herself perfectly
      still, and resolved to think no more; and, as far as the power of the mind
      over itself can stay the ever-rising thoughts, she controlled hers, and
      waited with a sort of forced, desperate composure for the event. Suddenly
      she heard that knock, that ring, which she knew announced Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s
      return. But not Cecilia alone; she heard the general also coming upstairs,
      but Cecilia first, who did not stop for more than an instant at the
      drawing-room door:&mdash;she looked in, as Helen guessed, and seeing that
      no one was there, ran very quickly up the next flight of stairs. Next came
      the general:&mdash;on hearing his step, Helen&rsquo;s anxiety became so intense,
      that she could not, at the moment he came near, catch the sound or
      distinguish which way he went. Strained beyond its power, the faculty of
      hearing seemed suddenly to fail&mdash;all was confusion, an indistinct
      buzz of sounds. The next moment, however, recovering, she plainly heard
      his step in the front drawing-room, and she knew that he twice walked up
      and down the whole length of the room, as if in deep thought. Each time as
      he approached the folding doors she was breathless. At last he stopped,
      his hand was on the lock&mdash;she recollected that the door was bolted,
      and as he turned the handle she, in a powerless voice, called to tell him,
      but not hearing her, he tried again, and as the door shook she again tried
      to speak, but could not. Still she heard, though she could not articulate.
      She heard him say, &ldquo;Miss Stanley, are you there? Can I see you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the words&mdash;the voice seemed to come from afar&mdash;sounded dull
      and strange. She tried to rise from her seat&mdash;found a difficulty&mdash;made
      an effort&mdash;stood up&mdash;she summoned resolution&mdash;struggled&mdash;hurried
      across the room&mdash;drew back the bolt&mdash;threw open the door&mdash;and
      that was all she could do. In that effort strength and consciousness
      failed&mdash;she fell forward and fainted at the general&rsquo;s feet. He raised
      her up, and laid her on the sofa in the inner room. He rang for her maid,
      and went up-stairs to prevent Cecilia&rsquo;s being alarmed. He took the matter
      coolly: he had seen many fainting young ladies, he did not like them&mdash;his
      own Cecilia excepted&mdash;in his mind always excepted from every
      unfavourable suspicion regarding the sex. Helen, on the contrary, was at
      present subject to them all, and, under the cloud of distrust, he saw in a
      bad light every thing that occurred; the same appearances which, in his
      wife, he would have attributed to the sensibility of true feeling, he
      interpreted in Helen as the consciousness of falsehood, the proof of
      cowardly duplicity. He went back at once to his original prejudice against
      her, when, as he first thought, she had been forced upon him in preference
      to his own sister. He had been afterwards convinced that she had been
      perfectly free from all double dealing; yet now he slid back again, as
      people of his character often do, to their first opinion. &ldquo;I thought so at
      first, and I find, as I usually do, that my first thought was right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What had been but an adverse feeling was now considered as a prescient
      judgment. And he did not go upstairs the quicker for these thoughts, but
      calmly and coolly, when he reached Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s dressing-room, knocked
      at the door, and, with all the precautions necessary to prevent her from
      being alarmed, told her what had happened. &ldquo;You had better not go down, my
      dear Cecilia, I beg you will not. Miss Stanley has her own maid, all the
      assistance that can be wanted. My dear, it is not fit for you. I desire
      you will not go down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Lady Cecilia would not listen, could not be detained; she escaped from
      her husband, and ran down to Helen. Excessively alarmed she was, and well
      she might be, knowing herself to be the cause, and not certain in any way
      how it might end. She found Helen a little recovered, but still pale as
      white marble; and when Lady Cecilia took her hand, it was still quite
      cold. She came to herself but very slowly. For some minutes she did not
      recover perfect consciousness, or clear recollection. She saw figures of
      persons moving about her, she felt them as if too near, and wished them
      away; wanted air, but could not say what she wished. She would have moved,
      but her limbs would not obey her will. At last, when she had with effort
      half raised her head, it sunk back again before she could distinguish all
      the persons in the room. The shock of cold water on her forehead revived
      her; then coming clearly to power of perception, she saw Cecilia bending
      over her. But still she could not speak, and yet she understood
      distinctly, saw the affectionate anxiety, too, in her little maid Rose&rsquo;s
      countenance; she felt that she loved Rose, and that she could not endure
      Felicie, who had now come in, and was making exclamations, and advising
      various remedies, all of which, when offered, Helen declined. It was not
      merely that Felicie&rsquo;s talking, and tone of voice, and superabundant
      action, were too much for her; but that Helen had at this moment a sort of
      intuitive perception of insincerity, and of exaggeration. In that dreamy
      state, hovering between life and death, in which people are on coming out
      of a swoon, it seems as if there was need for a firm hold of reality; the
      senses and the understanding join in the struggle, and become most acute
      in their perception of what is natural or what is unnatural, true or
      false, in the expressions and feelings of the by-standers. Lady Cecilia
      understood her look, and dismissed Felicie, with all her smelling-bottles.
      Rose, though not ordered away, judiciously retired as soon as she saw that
      her services were of no further use, and that there was something upon her
      young lady&rsquo;s mind, for which, hartshorn and sal volatile could be of no
      avail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia would have kissed her forehead, but Helen made a slight
      withdrawing motion, and turned away her face: the next instant, however,
      she looked up, and taking Cecilia&rsquo;s hand, pressed it kindly, and said,
      &ldquo;You are more to be pitied than I am; sit down, sit down beside me, my
      poor Cecilia; how you tremble! and yet you do not know what is coming upon
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I do&mdash;I do,&rdquo; cried Lady Cecilia, and she eagerly told
      Helen all that had passed, ending with the assurance that the publication
      had been completely stopped by her dear Clarendon; that the whole chapter
      containing the letters had been destroyed, that not a single copy had got
      abroad. &ldquo;The only one in existence is this,&rdquo; said she, taking it up as she
      spoke, and she made a movement as if going to tear out the leaves, but
      Helen checked her hand, &ldquo;That must not be, the general desired&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And almost breathless, yet distinctly, she repeated what the general had
      said, that he might be called upon to prove which parts were forged, and
      which true, and that she had promised to mark the passages. &ldquo;So now,
      Cecilia, here is a pencil, and mark what is and what is not yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia instantly took the pencil, and in great agitation obeyed.
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear Helen, some of these the general could not think yours. Very
      wicked these people have been!&mdash;so the general said; he was sure, he
      knew, all could not be yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finish! my dear Cecilia,&rdquo; interrupted Helen; &ldquo;finish what you have to do,
      and in this last trial, give me this one proof of your sincerity. Be
      careful in what you are now doing, mark truly&mdash;oh, Cecilia! every
      word you recollect&mdash;as your conscience tells you. Will you, Cecilia?
      this is all I ask, as I am to answer for it&mdash;will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Most fervently she protested she would. She had no difficulty in
      recollecting, in distinguishing her own; and at first she marked truly,
      and was glad to separate what was at worst only foolish girlish nonsense
      from things which had been interpolated to make out the romance; things
      which never could have come from her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is some comfort in having our own faults overshadowed, outdone by
      the greater faults of others. And here it was flagrant wickedness in the
      editor, and only weakness and imprudence in the writer of the real
      letters. Lady Cecilia continually solaced her conscience by pointing out
      to Helen, as she went on, the folly, literally the folly, of the deception
      she had practised on her husband; and her exclamations against herself
      were so vehement that Helen would not add to her pain by a single
      reproach, since she had decided that the time was past for urging her
      confession to the general. She now only said, &ldquo;Look to the future,
      Cecilia, the past we cannot recall. This will be a lesson you can never
      forget.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, never, never can I forget it. You have saved me, Helen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tears and protestations followed these words, and at the moment they were
      all sincere; and yet, can it be believed? even in this last trial, when it
      came to this last proof, Lady Cecilia was not perfectly true. She
      purposely avoided putting her mark of acknowledgment to any of those
      expressions which most clearly proved her love for Colonel D&rsquo;Aubigny; for
      she still said to herself that the time might come, though at present it
      could not be, when she might make a confession to her husband,&mdash;in
      his joy at the birth of a son, she thought she might venture; she still
      looked forward to doing justice to her friend at some future period, and
      to make this easier&mdash;to make this possible&mdash;as she said to
      herself, she must now leave out certain expressions, which might, if
      acknowledged, remain for ever fixed in Clarendon&rsquo;s mind, and for which she
      could never be forgiven.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen, when she looked over the pages, observed among the unmarked
      passages some of those expressions which she had thought were Cecilia&rsquo;s,
      but she concluded she was mistaken: she could not believe that her friend
      could at such a moment deceive her, and she was even ashamed of having
      doubted her sincerity; and her words, look, and manner, now gave assurance
      of perfect unquestioning confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      This delicacy in Helen struck Lady Cecilia to the quick. Ever apt to be
      more touched by her refined feelings than by any strong appeal to her
      reason or her principles, she was now shocked by the contrast between her
      own paltering meanness and her friend&rsquo;s confiding generosity. As this
      thought crossed her mind, she stretched out her hand again for the book,
      took up the pencil, and was going to mark the truth; but, the impulse
      past, cowardice prevailed, and cowardice whispered, &ldquo;Helen is looking at
      me, Helen sees at this moment what I am doing, and, after having marked
      them as not mine, how can I now acknowledge them?&mdash;it is too late&mdash;it
      is impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have done as you desired,&rdquo; continued she, &ldquo;Helen, to the best of my
      ability. I have marked all this, but what can it signify now my dear,
      except&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen interrupted her. &ldquo;Take the book to the general this moment, will
      you, and tell him that all the passages are marked as he desired; stay, I
      had better write.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She wrote upon a slip of paper a message to the same effect, having well
      considered the words by which she might, without further step in
      deception, save her friend, and take upon herself the whole blame&mdash;the
      whole hazardous responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Cecilia gave the marked book to General Clarendon, he said, as he
      took it, &ldquo;I am glad she has done this, though it is unnecessary now, as I
      was going to tell her if she had not fainted: unnecessary, because I have
      now in my possession the actual copies of the original letters; I found
      them here on my return. That good little poetess found them for me at the
      printer&rsquo;s&mdash;but she could not discover&mdash;I have not yet been able
      to trace where they came from, or by whom they were copied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O let me see them,&rdquo; cried Lady Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet, my love,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;you would know nothing more by seeing them;
      they are in a feigned hand evidently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; interrupted Cecilia, &ldquo;you cannot want the book now, when you have
      the letters themselves;&rdquo; and she attempted to draw it from his hand, for
      she instantly perceived the danger of the discrepancies between her marks
      and the letters being detected. She made a stronger effort to withdraw the
      book but he held it fast. &ldquo;Leave it with me now, my dear; I want it; it
      will settle my opinion as to Helen&rsquo;s truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly, and absolutely sickened with apprehension, Lady Cecilia withdrew.
      When she returned to Helen, and found how pale she was and how exhausted
      she seemed, she entreated her to lie down again and try to rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I believe I had better rest before I see Granville,&rdquo; said Helen:
      &ldquo;where can he have been all day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With some friend of his, I suppose,&rdquo; said Cecilia, and she insisted on
      Helen&rsquo;s saying no more, and keeping herself perfectly quiet. She farther
      suggested that she had better not appear at dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be only a family party, some of the general&rsquo;s relations. Miss
      Clarendon is to be here, and she is one, you know, trying to the spirits;
      and she is not likely to be in her most <i>suave</i> humour this evening,
      as she has been under a course of the tooth-ache, and has been all day at
      the dentist&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen readily consented to remain in her own room, though she had not so
      great a dread of Miss Clarendon as Lady Cecilia seemed to feel. Lady
      Cecilia was indeed in the greatest terror lest Miss Clarendon should have
      heard some of these reports about Helen and Beauclerc, and would in her
      blunt way ask directly what they meant, and go on with some of her
      point-blank questions, which Cecilia feared might be found unanswerable.
      However, as Miss Clarendon had only just come to town from Wales, and come
      only about her teeth, she hoped that no reports could have reached her;
      and Cecilia trusted much to her own address and presence of mind in
      moments of danger, in turning the conversation the way it should go.
    </p>
    <p>
      But things were now come to a point where none of the little skilful
      interruptions or lucky hits, by which she had so frequently profited,
      could avail her farther than to delay what must be. Passion and character
      pursue their course unalterably, unimpeded by small external
      circumstances; interrupted they may be in their progress, but as the
      stream opposed bears against the obstacle, sweeps it away, or foams and
      passes by.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s toilette was finished her husband was in her
      dressing-room; came in without knocking,&mdash;a circumstance so unusual
      with him, that Mademoiselle Felicie&rsquo;s eyes opened to their utmost orbit,
      and, without waiting for word or look, she vanished, leaving the bracelet
      half clasped on her lady&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cecilia!&rdquo; said the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke in so stern a tone that she trembled from head to foot; her last
      falsehood about the letters&mdash;all her falsehoods, all her
      concealments, were, she thought, discovered; unable to support herself,
      she sank into his arms. He seated her, and went on in a cool, inexorable
      tone, &ldquo;Cecilia, I am determined not to sanction by any token of my public
      approbation this marriage, which I no longer in my private conscience
      desire or approve; I will not be the person to give Miss Stanley to my
      ward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia almost screamed: her selfish fears forgotten, she felt only
      terror for her friend. She exclaimed, &ldquo;Clarendon, will you break off the
      marriage? Oh! Helen, what will become of her! Clarendon, what can you
      mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that I have compared the passages that Helen marked in the book,
      with those copies of the letters which were given to the bookseller before
      the interpolations were made&mdash;the letters as Miss Stanley wrote them.
      The passages in the letters and the passages marked in the book do not
      agree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but she might have forgotten, it might be accident,&rdquo; cried Cecilia,
      overwhelmed with confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Cecilia,&rdquo; pursued the General, in a tone which made her heart die
      within her&mdash;&ldquo;no, Cecilia, it is not accident, it is design. I
      perceive that every strong expression, every word, in short, which could
      show her attachment to that man, has been purposely marked as not her own,
      and the letters themselves prove that they were her own. The truth is not
      in her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In an agitation, which prevented all power of thought, Cecilia exclaimed,
      &ldquo;She mistook&mdash;she mistook; I could not, I am sure, recollect; she
      asked me if I remembered any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She consulted you, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She asked my advice,&mdash;told me that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I particularly requested her,&rdquo; interrupted the general, &ldquo;not to ask your
      advice; I desired her not to speak to you on the subject&mdash;not to
      consult you. Deceit&mdash;double-dealing in every thing she does, I find.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, it is my fault; every thing I say and do is wrong,&rdquo; cried Lady
      Cecilia. &ldquo;I recollect now&mdash;it was just after her fainting, when I
      brought the book, and when she took it to mark she really was not able. It
      was not that she consulted me, but I forced my counsel upon her. I looked
      over the letters, and said what I thought&mdash;if anybody is wrong, it is
      I, Clarendon. Oh, do not visit my sins upon Helen so cruelly!&mdash;do not
      make me the cause of her ruin, innocent creature! I assure you, if you do
      this, I never could forgive myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general looked at her in silence: she did not dare to meet his eyes,
      desperately anxious as she was to judge by his countenance what was
      passing within. He clasped for her that bracelet which her trembling hands
      were in vain attempting to close.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor thing, how its heart beats!&rdquo; said her husband, pressing her to him
      as he sat down beside her. Cecilia thought she might venture to speak.&mdash;&ldquo;You
      know, my dear Clarendon, I never oppose&mdash;interfere with&mdash;any
      determination of yours when once it is fixed&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is fixed,&rdquo; interrupted the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But after all you have done for her this very day, for which I am sure
      she&mdash;I am sure I thank you from my soul, would you now undo it all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is saved from public shame,&rdquo; said the general; &ldquo;from private contempt
      I cannot save her: who can save those who have not truth? But my
      determination is fixed; it is useless to waste words on the subject.
      Esther is come; I must go to her. And now, Cecilia, I conjure you, when
      you see Beauclerc&mdash;I have not seen him all day&mdash;I do not know
      where he has been&mdash;I conjure you&mdash;-I command you not to
      interfere between him and Helen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you would not have me give her up! I should be the basest of human
      beings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know what you mean, Cecilia; you have done for her all that an
      honourable friend could do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not an honourable friend,&rdquo; was Cecilia&rsquo;s bitter consciousness, as
      she pressed her hand upon her heart, which throbbed violently with
      contending fears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have done all that an honourable friend could do; more must not be
      done,&rdquo; continued the general. &ldquo;And now recollect, Cecilia, that you are my
      wife as well as Miss Stanley&rsquo;s friend;&rdquo; and, as he said these words, he
      left the room.

      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      That knowing French minister, Louvois, whose power is said to have been
      maintained by his surpassing skill in collecting and spreading secret and
      swift intelligence, had in his pay various classes of unsuspected agents,
      dancing-masters, fencing-masters, language-masters, milliners,
      hairdressers and barbers&mdash;dentists, he would have added, had he lived
      to our times; and not all Paris could have furnished him with a person
      better suited to his purpose than the most fashionable London dentist of
      the day, St. Leger Swift. Never did Frenchman exceed him in volubility of
      utterance, or in gesture significant, supplying all that words might fear
      or fail to tell; never was he surpassed by prattling barber or privileged
      hunchback in ancient or modern story, Arabian or Persian; but he was not a
      malicious, only a coxcomb scandal-monger, triumphing in his <i>sçavoir
      dire</i>. St. Leger Swift was known to everybody&mdash;knew everybody in
      London that was to be or was not to be known, every creature dead or alive
      that ever had been, or was about to be celebrated, fashionable, or rich,
      or clever, or notorious, <i>roué</i> or murderer, about to be married or
      about to be hanged&mdash;for that last class of persons enjoys in our days
      a strange kind of heroic celebrity, of which Voltaire might well have been
      jealous. St, Leger was, of course, hand and glove with all the royal
      family; every illustrious personage&mdash;every most illustrious personage&mdash;had
      in turn sat in his chair; he had had all their heads, in their turns, in
      his hands, and he had capital anecdotes and sayings of each, with which he
      charmed away the sense of pain in loyal subjects. But with scandal for the
      fair was he specially provided. Never did man or woman skim the surface
      tittle-tattle of society, or dive better, breathless, into family
      mysteries; none, with more careless air, could at the same time talk and
      listen&mdash;extract your news and give you his <i>on dit</i>, or tell the
      secret which you first reveal. There was in him and about him such an air
      of reckless, cordial coxcombry, it warmed the coldest, threw the most
      cautious off their guard, brought out family secrets as if he had been one
      of your family&mdash;your secret purpose as though he had been a secular
      father confessor; as safe every thing told to St. Leger Swift, he would
      swear to you, as if known only to yourself: he would swear, and you would
      believe, unless peculiarly constituted, as was the lady who, this morning,
      took her seat in his chair&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Clarendon. She was accompanied by her aunt, Mrs. Pennant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! old lady and young lady, fresh from the country. Both, I see, persons
      of family&mdash;of condition,&rdquo; said St. Leger to himself. On that point
      his practised eye could not mistake, even at first glance; and accordingly
      it was really doing himself a pleasure, and these ladies, as he conceived
      it, a pleasure, a service, and an honour, to put them, immediately on
      their arrival in town, <i>au courant du jour</i>. Whether to pull or not
      to pull a tooth that had offended, was the professional question before
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Clarendon threw back her head, and opened her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine teeth, fine! Nothing to complain of here surely,&rdquo; said St. Leger.
      &ldquo;As fine a show of ivory as ever I beheld. &lsquo;Pon my reputation, I know many
      a fine lady who would give&mdash;all but her eyes for such a set.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must have this tooth out,&rdquo; said Miss Clarendon, pointing to the
      offender.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see; certainly, ma&rsquo;am, as you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope, sir, you don&rsquo;t think it necessary,&rdquo; said her tender-hearted aunt:
      &ldquo;if it could be any way avoided&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all means, madam, as you say. We must do nothing without
      consideration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have considered, my dear aunt,&rdquo; said Miss Clarendon. &ldquo;I have not slept
      these three nights.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you do not consider that you caught cold getting up one night for me;
      and it may be only an accidental cold, my dear Esther. I should be so
      sorry if you were to lose a tooth. Don&rsquo;t be in a hurry; once gone, you
      cannot get it back again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never was a truer, wiser word spoken, madam,&rdquo; said St. Leger, swiftly
      whisking himself round, and as if looking for some essential implement.
      &ldquo;May be a mere twinge, accidental cold, rheumatism; or may be&mdash;&mdash;My
      dear madam&rdquo; (to the aunt), &ldquo;I will trouble you; let me pass. I beg pardon&mdash;one
      word with you,&rdquo; and with his back to the patient in the chair, while he
      rummaged among ivory-handled instruments on the table, he went on in a low
      voice to the aunt&mdash;&ldquo;Is she nervous? is she nervous, eh, eh, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pennant looked, but did not hear, for she was a little deaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, yes; I see how it is. A word to the wise,&rdquo; replied he, with a
      nod of intelligence. &ldquo;Every lady&rsquo;s nervous now-a-days, more or less. Where
      the deuce did I put this thing? Yes, yes&mdash;nerves;&mdash;all the same
      to me; know how to manage. Make it a principle&mdash;professional, to
      begin always by talking away nerves. You shall see, you shall see, my
      dearest madam; you shall soon see&mdash;you shall hear, you shall hear how
      I&rsquo;ll talk this young lady&mdash;your niece&mdash;out of her nerves fairly.
      Beg pardon, Miss&mdash;&mdash;, one instant. I am searching for&mdash;where
      have I put it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir: I am a little deaf,&rdquo; said Mrs. Pennant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deaf&mdash;hey? Ha! a little deaf. So everybody is now-a-days; even the
      most illustrious personages, more or less. Death and deafness common to
      all&mdash;<i>mors omnibus</i>. I have it. Now, my dear young lady, let us
      have another look and touch at these beautiful teeth. Your head will do
      very&mdash;vastly well, my dear ma&rsquo;am&mdash;Miss&mdash;&mdash;um, um, um!&rdquo;
       hoping the name would be supplied. But that Miss Clarendon did not tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      So raising his voice to the aunt as he went on looking, or seeming to
      look, at the niece&rsquo;s tooth, he continued rapidly&mdash;&ldquo;From Wales you
      are, ma&rsquo;am? a beautiful country Wales, ma&rsquo;am. Very near being born there
      myself, like, ha, ha, ha! that Prince of Wales&mdash;first Prince&mdash;Caernarvon
      Castle&mdash;you know the historical anecdote. Never saw finer teeth, upon
      my reputation. Are you ladies, may I ask, for I&rsquo;ve friends in both
      divisions&mdash;are you North or South Wales, eh, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;South, sir. Llansillen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, South. The most picturesque certainly. Llansillen, Llansillen; know
      it; know everybody ten miles round. Respectable people&mdash;all&mdash;very;
      most respectable people come up from Wales continually. Some of our best
      blood from Wales, as a great personage observed lately to me,&mdash;Thick,
      thick! not thicker blood than the Welsh. His late Majesty, <i>à-propos</i>,
      was pleased to say to me once&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; interrupted Miss Clarendon, &ldquo;what do you say to my tooth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sound as a roach, my dear ma&rsquo;am; I will insure it for a thousand pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that, the tooth you touch, is not the tooth I mean: pray look at
      this, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, my dear madam, a little in my light,&rdquo; said he to the aunt.
      &ldquo;May I beg the favour of your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pennant! ah! ah! ah!&rdquo; with his hands in uplifted admiration&mdash;&ldquo;I
      thought so&mdash;Pennant. I said so to myself, for I know so many Pennants&mdash;great
      family resemblance&mdash;Great naturalist of that name&mdash;any relation?
      Oh yes&mdash;No&mdash;I thought so from the first. Yes&mdash;and can
      assure you, to my private certain knowledge, that man stood high on the
      pinnacle of favour with a certain royal personage,&mdash;for, often
      sitting in this very chair&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep your mouth open&mdash;a little longer&mdash;little wider, my good
      Miss Pennant. Here&rsquo;s a little something for me to do, nothing of any
      consequence&mdash;only touch and go&mdash;nothing to be taken away, no,
      no, must not lose one of these fine teeth. That most illustrious personage
      said one day to me, sitting in this very chair&mdash;&lsquo;Swift,&rsquo; said he,
      &lsquo;St. Leger Swift,&rsquo; familiarly, condescendingly, colloquially&mdash;&lsquo;St.
      Leger Swift, my good fellow,&rsquo; said he&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But positively, my dear Miss&mdash;um, um, if you have not patience&mdash;you
      must sit still&mdash;pardon me, professionally I must be peremptory.
      Impossible I could hurt&mdash;can&rsquo;t conceive&mdash;did not touch&mdash;only
      making a perquisition&mdash;inquisition&mdash;say what you please, but you
      are nervous, ma&rsquo;am; I am only taking a general survey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A-propos&mdash;general survey&mdash;General&mdash;a friend of mine,
      General Clarendon is just come to town. My ears must have played me false,
      but I thought my man said something like Clarendon when he showed you up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No answer from Miss Clarendon, who held her mouth open wide, as desired,
      resolved not to satisfy his curiosity, but to let him blunder on. &ldquo;Be that
      as it may, General Clarendon&rsquo;s come to town&mdash;fine teeth he has too&mdash;and
      a fine kettle of fish&mdash;not very elegant, but expressive still&mdash;he
      and his ward have made, of that marriage announced. Fine young man,
      though, that Beauclerc&mdash;finest young man, almost, I ever saw!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But here Mr. St. Leger Swift, starting suddenly, withdrawing his hand from
      Miss Clarendon&rsquo;s mouth, exclaimed,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My finger, ma&rsquo;am! but never mind, never mind, all in the day&rsquo;s work.
      Casualty&mdash;contingencies&mdash;no consequence. But as I was saying,
      Mr. Granville Beauclerc&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then poured out, on the encouragement of one look of curiosity from Mrs.
      Pennant, all the <i>on dits</i> of Lady Katrine Hawksby, and all her
      chorus, and all the best authorities; and St. Leger Swift was ready to
      pledge himself to the truth of every word. He positively knew that the
      marriage was off, and thought, as everybody did, that the young gentleman
      was well off too; for besides the young lady&rsquo;s great fortune turning out
      not a <i>sous</i>&mdash;and here he supplied the half-told tale by a
      drawn-up ugly face and shrugging gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shocking! shocking! all came to an <i>éclat&mdash;esclandre</i>; a scene
      quite, last night, I am told, at my friend Lady Castlefort&rsquo;s. Sad&mdash;sad&mdash;so
      young a lady! But to give you a general idea, love letters to come out in
      the Memoirs of that fashionable Roué&mdash;friend of mine too&mdash;fine
      fellow as ever breathed&mdash;only a little&mdash;you understand; Colonel
      D&rsquo;Aubigny&mdash;Poor D&rsquo;Atibigny, heigho!&mdash;only if the book comes out&mdash;Miss
      Stanley&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pennant looked at her niece in benevolent anxiety; Miss Clarendon was
      firmly silent; but St. Leger, catching from the expression of both ladies&rsquo; 
      countenances, that they were interested in the contrary direction to what
      he had anticipated, turned to the right about, and observed,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This may be all scandal, one of the innumerable daily false reports that
      are always flying about town; scandal all, I have no doubt&mdash;Your head
      a little to the right, if you please&mdash;And the publication will be
      stopped, of course, and the young lady&rsquo;s friends&mdash;you are interested
      for her, I see; so am I&mdash;always am for the young and fair, that&rsquo;s my
      foible; and indeed, confidentially I can inform you&mdash;If you could
      keep your head still, my dear madam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Miss Clarendon could bear it no longer; starting from under his hand,
      she exclaimed, &ldquo;No more, thank you&mdash;no more at present, sir: we can
      call another day&mdash;no more:&rdquo; and added as she hastily left the room,
      &ldquo;Better bear the toothache,&rdquo; and ran down stairs. Mrs. Pennant slipped
      into the dentist&rsquo;s hand, as he pulled the bell, a double fee; for though
      she did not quite think he deserved it much, yet she felt it necessary to
      make amends for her niece&rsquo;s way of running off, which might not be thought
      quite civil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;thank ye, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;not the least occasion&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      say a word about it&mdash;Young lady&rsquo;s nervous, said so from the first.
      Nerves! nerves! all&mdash;open the door there&mdash;Nerves all,&rdquo; were the
      last words, at the top of the stairs, St. Leger Swift was heard to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the first words of kind Mrs. Pennant, as soon as she was in the
      carriage and had drawn up the glass, were, &ldquo;Do you know, Esther, my dear,
      I am quite sorry for this poor Miss Stanley. Though I don&rsquo;t know her, yet,
      as you described her to me, she was such a pretty, young, interesting
      creature! I am quite sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe a word of it,&rdquo; said Miss Clarendon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But even to have such things said must be so distressing to her and to
      her lover, your friend Mr. Beauclerc&mdash;so very distressing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope they are not such fools as to be distressed about such stuff. All
      this insufferable talking man&rsquo;s invention, I dare say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do people tell such things?&rdquo; said Mrs. Pennant. &ldquo;But, my dear Esther,
      even supposing it to be all false, it is shocking to have such things
      spoken of. I pity the poor young lady and her lover. Do you not think, my
      dear, we shall be able to inquire into the truth of the matter from your
      brother this evening? He must know, he ought to know about it: whether the
      report be true or false, he should hear of it. He can best judge what
      should be done, if any thing should be done, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Clarendon quite agreed with all this; indeed she almost always agreed
      with this aunt of hers, who, perhaps from the peculiar gentleness of her
      manner, joined to a simplicity and sincerity of character she could never
      doubt, had an ascendency over her, which no one, at first view, could have
      imagined. They had many country commissions to execute this morning, which
      naturally took up a good deal of aunt Pennant&rsquo;s attention. But between
      each return from shop to carriage, in the intervals between one commission
      off her hands and another on her mind, she returned regularly to &ldquo;that
      poor Miss Stanley, and those love-letters!&rdquo; and she sighed. Dear
      kind-hearted old lady! she had always a heart, as well as a hand, open as
      day to melting charity&mdash;charity in the most enlarged sense of the
      word: charity in judging as well as charity in giving. She was all
      indulgence for human nature, for youth and love especially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must take care, my dear Esther,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;to be at General
      Clarendon&rsquo;s early, as you will like to have some little time with him to
      yourself before any one else arrives&mdash;shall you not, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied Miss Clarendon; &ldquo;I shall learn the truth from my
      brother in five minutes, if Lady Cecilia does not come between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, my dear Esther, I cannot think so ill of Lady Cecilia; I cannot
      believe&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear aunt, I know you cannot think ill of any body. Stay till you
      know Lady Cecilia Clarendon as I do. If there is any thing wrong in this
      business, you will find that some falsehood of hers is at the bottom of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear, do not say so before you know; perhaps, as you thought at
      first, we shall find that it is all only a mistake of that giddy
      dentist&rsquo;s; for your brother&rsquo;s sake try to think as well as you can of his
      wife; she is a charming agreeable creature, I am sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve only seen her once, my dear aunt,&rdquo; said Miss Clarendon. &ldquo;For my
      brother&rsquo;s sake I would give up half her agreeableness for one ounce&mdash;for
      one scruple&mdash;of truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, take it with some grains of allowance, my dear niece; and, at
      any rate, do not suffer yourself to be so prejudiced as to conceive she
      can be in fault in this business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall see to-day,&rdquo; said Miss Clarendon; &ldquo;I will not be prejudiced; but
      I remember hearing at Florence that this Colonel D&rsquo;Aubigny had been an
      admirer of Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s. I will get at the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this determination, and in pursuance of the resolve to be early, they
      were at General Clarendon&rsquo;s full a quarter of an hour before the arrival
      of any other company; but Lady Cecilia entered so immediately after the
      general, that Miss Clarendon had no time to speak with her brother alone.
      Determined, however, as she was, to get at the truth, without preface, or
      even smoothing her way to her object, she rushed into the middle of things
      at once. &ldquo;Have you heard any reports about Miss Stanley, brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, Lady Cecilia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you heard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia was silent, looked at the general, and left it to him to
      speak as much or as little as he pleased. She trusted to his laconic mode
      of answering, which, without departing from truth, defied curiosity. Her
      trust in him upon the present occasion was, however, a little disturbed by
      her knowledge of his being at this moment particularly displeased with
      Helen. But, had she known the depths as well as she knew the surface of
      his character, her confidence in his caution would have been increased,
      instead of being diminished by this circumstance: Helen was lost in his
      esteem, but she was still under his protection; her secrets were not only
      sacred, but, as far as truth and honour could admit, he would still serve
      and save her. Impenetrable, therefore, was his look, and brief was his
      statement to his sister. A rascally bookseller had been about to publish a
      book, in which were some letters which paragraphs in certain papers had
      led the public to believe were Miss Stanley&rsquo;s; the publication had been
      stopped, the offensive chapter suppressed, and the whole impression
      destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, brother,&rdquo; pursued Miss Clarendon, &ldquo;were the letters Miss Stanley&rsquo;s,
      or not? You know I do not ask from idle curiosity, but from regard for
      Miss Stanley;&rdquo; and she turned her inquiring eyes full upon Lady Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe, my dear Esther,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia, &ldquo;I believe we had better
      say no more; you had better inquire no further.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That must be a bad case which can bear no inquiry,&rdquo; said Miss Clarendon;
      &ldquo;which cannot admit any further question, even from one most disposed to
      think well of the person concerned&mdash;a desperately bad case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad! no, Esther. It would be cruel of you so to conclude: and falsely it
      would be&mdash;might be; indeed, Esther! my dear Esther!&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       Her husband&rsquo;s eyes were upon Lady Cecilia, and she did not dare to justify
      Helen decidedly; her imploring look and tone, and her confusion, touched
      the kind aunt, but did not stop the impenetrable niece.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Falsely, do you say? Do you say, Lady Cecilia, that it would be to
      conclude falsely? Perhaps not falsely though, upon the data given to me.
      The data may be false.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Data! I do not know what you mean exactly, Esther,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia, in
      utter confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean exactly what I say,&rdquo; pursued Miss Clarendon; &ldquo;that if I reason
      wrong, and come to a false conclusion, or what you call a cruel
      conclusion, it is not my fault, but the fault of those who do not plainly
      tell me the facts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked from Lady Cecilia to her brother, and from her brother to Lady
      Cecilia. On her brother no effect was produced: calm, unalterable, looked
      he; as though his face had been turned to stone. Lady Cecilia struggled in
      vain to be composed. &ldquo;I wish I could tell you, Esther,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;but
      facts cannot always&mdash;all facts&mdash;even the most innocent&mdash;that
      is, even with the best intentions&mdash;cannot always be all told, even in
      the defence of one&rsquo;s best friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If this be the best defence you can make for your best friend, I am glad
      you will never have to defend me, and I am sorry for Helen Stanley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear Esther!&rdquo; said her aunt, with a remonstrating look; for,
      though she had not distinctly heard all that was said, she saw that things
      were going wrong, and that Esther was making them worse. &ldquo;Indeed, Esther,
      my dear, we had better let this matter rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let this matter rest!&rdquo; repeated Miss Clarendon; &ldquo;that is not what you
      would say, my dear aunt, if you were to hear any evil report of me. If any
      suspicion fell like a blast on my character you would never say &lsquo;let it
      rest.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fire lighted in her brother&rsquo;s eyes, and the stone face was all animated,
      and he looked sudden sympathy, and he cried, &ldquo;You are right, sister, in
      principle, but wrong in&mdash;fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Set me right where only I am wrong then,&rdquo; cried she.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to stone again, and her aunt in a low voice, said, &ldquo;Not now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now or never,&rdquo; said the sturdy champion; &ldquo;it is for Miss Stanley&rsquo;s
      character. You are interested for her, are not you, aunt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, I am indeed; but we do not know all the circumstances&mdash;we
      cannot&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we must. You do not know, brother, how public these reports are. Mr.
      St. Leger Swift, the dentist, has been chattering to us all morning about
      them. So, to go to the bottom of the business at once, will you, Lady
      Cecilia, answer me one straight-forward question?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Straight-forward question! what is coming? thought Lady Cecilia: her face
      flushed, and taking up a hand-screen, she turned away, as if from the
      scorching fire; but it was not a scorching fire, as everybody, or at least
      as Miss Clarendon, could see. The face turned away from Miss Clarendon was
      full in view of aunt Pennant, who was on her other side; and she, seeing
      the distressed state of the countenance, pitied, and gently laying her
      hand upon Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s arm, said, in her soft low voice, &ldquo;This must be a
      very painful subject to you, Lady Cecilia. I am sorry for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia, pressing her hand with quick gratitude for
      her sympathy. &ldquo;It is indeed to me a painful subject, for Helen has been my
      friend from childhood, and I have so much reason for loving her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Many contending emotions struggled in Cecilia&rsquo;s countenance, and she could
      say no more: but what she had said, what she had looked, had been quite
      enough to interest tenderly in her favour that kind heart to which it was
      addressed; and Cecilia&rsquo;s feeling was true at the instant; she forgot all
      but Helen; the screen was laid down; tears stood in her eyes&mdash;those
      beautiful eyes! &ldquo;If I could but tell you the whole&mdash;oh if I could!
      without destroying&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Clarendon at this moment placed herself close opposite to Cecilia,
      and, speaking so low that neither her brother nor her aunt could hear her,
      said, &ldquo;Without destroying yourself, or your friend&mdash;which?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia could not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not&mdash;I am answered,&rdquo; said Miss Clarendon; and returning to
      her place, she remained silent for some minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general rang, and inquired if Mr. Beauclerc had come in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general made no observation and then began some indifferent
      conversation with Mrs. Pennant, in which Lady Cecilia forced herself to
      join; she dreaded even Miss Clarendon&rsquo;s silence&mdash;that grim repose,&mdash;and
      well she might.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&rsquo;Aubigny&rsquo;s Memoirs, I think, was the title of the book, aunt, that the
      dentist talked of? That is the book you burnt, is not it, brother?&mdash;a
      chapter in that book?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      And again Miss Clarendon was silent; for though she well recollected what
      she had heard at Florence, and however strong were her suspicions, she
      might well pause; for she loved her brother before every thing but truth
      and justice,&mdash;she loved her brother too much to disturb his
      confidence. &ldquo;I have no proof,&rdquo; thought she; &ldquo;I might destroy his happiness
      by another word, and I may be wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But shall not we see Miss Stanley?&rdquo; said Mrs. Pennant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia was forced to explain that Helen was not very well, would not
      appear till after dinner&mdash;nothing very much the matter&mdash;a little
      faintish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fainted,&rdquo; said the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, quite worn out&mdash;she was at Lady Castlefort&rsquo;s last night&mdash;such
      a crowd!&rdquo; She went on to describe its city horrors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where is Mr. Beauclerc all this time?&rdquo; said Miss Clarendon: &ldquo;has he
      fainted too? or is he faintish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not likely,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia; &ldquo;faint heart never won fair lady. He is
      not of the faintish sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment a thundering knock at the door announced the rest of the
      company, and never was company more welcome. But Beauclerc did not appear.
      Before dinner was served, however, a note came from him to the general.
      Lady Cecilia stretched out her hand for it, and read,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MY DEAR FRIENDS,&mdash;I am obliged to dine out of town. I shall not
      return to-night, but you will see me at breakfast-time to-morrow. Yours
      ever, GRANVILLE BEAUCLERC.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cockburn now entered with a beautiful bouquet of hot-house flowers, which,
      he said, Mr. Beauclerc&rsquo;s man had brought with the note, and which were, he
      said, for Miss Stanley. Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s countenance grew radiant with joy,
      and she exclaimed, &ldquo;Give them to me,&mdash;I must have the pleasure of
      taking them to her myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she flew off with them. Aunt Pennant smiled on her as she passed, and,
      turning to her niece as Lady Cecilia left the room, said, &ldquo;What a bright
      creature! so warm, so affectionate!&rdquo; Miss Clarendon was indeed struck with
      the indisputably natural sincere satisfaction and affection in Cecilia&rsquo;s
      countenance; and, herself of such a different nature, could not comprehend
      the possibility of such contradiction in any character: she could not
      imagine the existence of such variable, transitory feelings&mdash;she
      could not believe any human being capable of sacrificing her friend to
      save herself, while she still so loved her victim, could still feel such
      generous sympathy for her. She determined at least to suspend her
      judgment; she granted Lady Cecilia a reprieve from her terrific questions
      and her as terrific looks. Cecilia recovered her presence of mind, and
      dinner went off delightfully, to her at least, with the sense of escape in
      recovered self-possession, and &ldquo;spirits light, to every joy in tune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the good-breeding of the company there was no danger that the topic
      she dreaded should be touched upon. Whatever reports might have gone
      forth, whatever any one present might have heard, nothing would assuredly
      be said of her friend Miss Stanley, to her, or before her, unless she or
      the general introduced the subject; and she was still more secure of his
      discretion than of her own. The conversation kept safe on London-dinner
      generalities and frivolities. Yet often things that were undesignedly said
      touched upon the <i>taboo&rsquo;d</i> matter; and those who knew when, where,
      and how it touched, looked at or from one another, and almost equally
      dangerous was either way of looking. Such perfect neutrality of expression
      is not given to all men in these emergencies as to General Clarendon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dessert over, out of the dinner-room and in the drawing-room, the
      ladies alone together, things were not so pleasant to Lady Cecilia.
      Curiosity peeped out more and more in great concern about Miss Stanley&rsquo;s
      health; and when ladies trifled over their coffee, and saw through all
      things with their half-shut eyes, they asked, and Lady Cecilia answered,
      and parried, and explained, and her conscience winced, and her countenance
      braved, and Miss Clarendon listened with that dreadfully good memory, that
      positive point-blank recollection, which permits not the slightest
      variation of statement. Her doubts and her suspicions returned, but she
      was silent; and sternly silent she remained the rest of the evening.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      If &ldquo;trifles light as air are to the jealous confirmations strong as proofs
      of Holy Writ,&rdquo; and that they are no one since the time of Othello could
      ever doubt, it may be some consolation to observe, on the credit side of
      human nature, that, to those who are not cursed with a jealous infirmity,
      trifles light as air are often confirmations strong of the constancy of
      affection. Well did Lady Cecilia know this when she was so eager to be the
      bearer of the flowers which were sent by Beauclerc. She foresaw and
      enjoyed the instant effect, the quick smile, and blush of delight with
      which that bouquet was received by Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thank you! How kind of him!&rdquo; and &ldquo;all&rsquo;s well,&rdquo; was her immediate
      conclusion. When she saw his note, she never even took notice that he did
      not particularly mention her. The flowers from him were enough; she knew
      his sincerity so well, trusted to it so completely, that she was quite
      sure, if he had been angry with her, he would not have sent these tokens
      of his love,&mdash;slight tokens, though they were all-sufficient for her.
      Her fears had taken but one direction, and in that direction they were all
      dispelled. He would be at breakfast to-morrow, when she should know where
      he had been, and what had detained him from her the whole of this day. She
      told Cecilia that she was now quite well, but that she would not attempt
      to go down stairs. And Cecilia left her happy, so far at least; and when
      she was alone with her flowers, she doubly enjoyed them, inhaling the
      fragrance of each which she knew he particularly liked, and thanking him
      in her heart for the careful choice, for she was certain that they were
      not accidentally put together. Some of them were associated with little
      circumstances known only to themselves, awakening recollections of bright,
      happy moments, and selected, she was sure, with reference to a recent
      conversation they had had on the language of flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether Helen fancied half this, or whether it was all true, it had the
      effect of soothing and pleasing her anxious, agitated mind; and she was
      the more ready to indulge in that pleasant reverie, from all that she had
      previously suffered herself, and all that she feared Beauclerc had yet to
      endure. She knew too well how much these reports would affect him&mdash;and
      hear them he must. She considered what trials he had already borne, and
      might still have to bear, for her sake, whatever course she might now
      pursue. Though soon, very soon, the whole would be told to him, yet still,
      though she might stand clear in his eyes as to the main points, he must,
      and would blame her weakness in first consenting to this deception&mdash;he
      who was above deceit. She had not absolutely <i>told</i>, but she had <i>admitted</i>
      a falsehood; she had <i>acted</i> a falsehood. This she could not
      extenuate. Her motive at first, to save Lady Davenant&rsquo;s life, was good;
      but then her weakness afterwards, in being persuaded time after time by
      Cecilia, could not well be excused. She was conscious that she had sunk
      step by step, dragged down that slippery path by Cecilia, instead of
      firmly making a stand, as she ought to have done, and up-holding by her
      own integrity her friend&rsquo;s failing truth. With returning anguish of
      self-reproach, she went over and over these thoughts; she considered the
      many unforeseen circumstances that had occurred. So much public shame, so
      much misery had been brought upon herself and on all she loved, by this
      one false step! And how much more might still await her, notwithstanding
      all that best of friends, the general, had done! She recollected how much
      he had done for her!&mdash;thinking of her too, as he must, with lowered
      esteem, and that was the most painful thought of all;&mdash;to Beauclerc
      she could and would soon clear her truth, but to the general&mdash;never,
      perhaps, completely!
    </p>
    <p>
      Her head was leaning on her hand, as she was sitting deep in these
      thoughts, when she was startled by an unusual knock at her door. It was
      Cockburn with a packet, which General Clarendon had ordered him to deliver
      into Miss Stanley&rsquo;s own hands. The instant she saw the packet she knew
      that it contained <i>the book;</i> and on opening it she found manuscript
      letters inserted between the marked pages, and there was a note from
      General Clarendon. She trembled&mdash;she foreboded ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The note began by informing Miss Stanley how the enclosed manuscript
      letters came into General Clarendon&rsquo;s hands from a person whom Miss
      Stanley had obliged, and who had hoped in return to do her some service.
      The general next begged Miss Stanley to understand that these letters had
      been put into his possession since his conversation with her at breakfast
      time; his only design in urging her to mark her share in the printed
      letters had been to obtain her authority for serving her to the best of
      his ability; but he had since compared them:&mdash;and then came
      references, without comment, to the discrepancies between the marked
      passages, the uniform character of the omissions, followed only by a
      single note of admiration at each from the general&rsquo;s pen. And at last, in
      cold polite phrase, came his regret that he had not been able to obtain
      that confidence which he had trusted he had deserved, and his renunciation
      of all future interference in her affairs&mdash;<i>or concerns</i>, had
      been written, but a broad dash of the pen had erased the superfluous
      words; and then came the inevitable conclusion, on which Helen&rsquo;s eyes
      fixed, and remained immovable for some time&mdash;that determination which
      General Clarendon had announced to his wife in the first heat of
      indignation, but which, Lady Cecilia had hoped, could be evaded, changed,
      postponed&mdash;would not at least be so suddenly declared to Helen;
      therefore she had given her no hint, had in no way prepared her for the
      blow,&mdash;and with the full force of astonishment it came upon her&mdash;&ldquo;General
      Clarendon cannot have the pleasure he had proposed to himself, of giving
      Miss Stanley at the altar to his ward. He cannot by any public act of his
      attest his consent to that marriage, of which, in his private opinion, he
      no longer approves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he is right. O Cecilia!&rdquo; was Helen&rsquo;s first thought, when she could
      think after this shock&mdash;not of her marriage, not of herself, not of
      Beauclerc, but of Cecilia&rsquo;s falsehood&mdash;Cecilia&rsquo;s selfish cowardice,
      she thought, and could not conceive it possible,&mdash;could not believe
      it, though it was there. &ldquo;Incredible&mdash;yet proved&mdash;there&mdash;there&mdash;before
      her eyes-brought home keen to her heart! after all! at such a time&mdash;after
      her most solemn promise, with so little temptation, so utterly false&mdash;with
      every possible motive that a good mind could have to be true&mdash;in this
      last trial&mdash;her friend&rsquo;s whole character at stake&mdash;ungenerous&mdash;base!
      O Cecilia! how different from what I thought you&mdash;or how changed! And
      I have helped to bring her to this!&mdash;I&mdash;I have been the cause.&mdash;I
      will not stay in this house&mdash;I will leave her. To save her&mdash;to
      save myself&mdash;save my own truth and my own real character&mdash;let
      the rest go as it will&mdash;the world think what it may! Farther and
      farther, lower and lower, I have gone: I will not go lower&mdash;I will
      struggle up again at any risk, at any sacrifice. This is a sacrifice Lady
      Davenant would approve of: she said that if ever I should be convinced
      that General Clarendon did not wish me to be his guest&mdash;if he should
      ever cease to esteem me&mdash;I should go, that instant&mdash;and I will
      go. But where? To whom could she fly, to whom turn? The Collingwoods were
      gone; all her uncle&rsquo;s friends passed rapidly through her recollection.
      Since she had been living with General and Lady Cecilia Clarendon, several
      had written to invite her; but Helen knew a little more of the world now
      than formerly, and she felt that there was not one, no, not one of all
      these, to whom she could now, at her utmost need, turn and say, &lsquo;I am in
      distress, receive me! my character is attacked, defend me! my truth is
      doubted, believe in me!&rsquo;&rdquo; And, her heart beating with anxiety, she tried
      to think what was to be done. There was an old Mrs. Medlicott, who had
      been a housekeeper of her uncle&rsquo;s, living at Seven Oaks&mdash;she would go
      there&mdash;she should be safe&mdash;she should be independent. She knew
      that she was then in town, and was to go to Seven Oaks the next day; she
      resolved to send Rose early in the morning to Mrs. Medlicott&rsquo;s lodging,
      which was near Grosvenor Square, to desire her to call at General
      Clarendon&rsquo;s as she went out of town, at eight o&rsquo;clock. She could then go
      with her to Seven Oaks; and, by setting out before Cecilia could be up,
      she should avoid seeing her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are minds which totally sink, and others that wonderfully rise,
      under the urgency of strong motive and of perilous circumstance. It is not
      always the mind apparently strongest or most daring that stands the test.
      The firm of principle are those most courageous in time of need. Helen had
      determined what her course should be, and, once determined, she was calm.
      She sat down and wrote to General Clarendon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MISS STANLEY regrets that she cannot explain to General Clarendon the
      circumstances which have so much displeased him. She assures him that no
      want of confidence has been, on her part, the cause; but she cannot expect
      that, without further explanation, he should give her credit for
      sincerity. She feels that with his view of her conduct, and in his
      situation, his determination is right,&mdash;that it is what she has
      deserved,&mdash;that it is just towards his ward and due to his own
      character. She hopes, however, that he will not think it necessary to
      announce to Mr. Beauclerc his determination of withdrawing his approbation
      and consent to his marriage, when she informs him that it will now never
      be by her claimed or accepted. She trusts that General Clarendon will
      permit her to take upon herself the breaking off this union. She encloses
      a letter to Mr. Beauclerc, which she begs may be given to him to-morrow.
      General Clarendon will find she has dissolved their engagement as
      decidedly as he could desire, and that her decision will be irrevocable.
      And since General Clarendon has ceased to esteem her, Miss Stanley cannot
      longer accept his protection, or encroach upon his hospitality. She trusts
      that he will not consider it as any want of respect, that she has resolved
      to retire from his family as soon as possible. She is certain of having a
      safe and respectable home with a former housekeeper of her uncle Dean
      Stanley&rsquo;s, who will call for her at eight o&rsquo;clock to-morrow, and take her
      to Seven Oaks, where she resides. Miss Stanley has named that early hour,
      that she may not meet Mr. Beauclerc before she goes; she wishes also to
      avoid the struggle and agony of parting with Lady Cecilia. She entreats
      General Clarendon will prevent Lady Cecilia from attempting to see her in
      the morning, and permit her to go unobserved out of the house at her
      appointed hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So now farewell, my dear friend&mdash;yes, friend, this last time you
      must permit me to call you; for such I feel you have ever been, and ever
      would have been, to me, if my folly would have permitted. Believe me&mdash;notwithstanding
      the deception of which I acknowledge I have been guilty towards you,
      General Clarendon&mdash;I venture to say, <i>believe me</i>, I am not
      ungrateful. At this instant my heart swells with gratitude, while I pray
      that you may be happy&mdash;happy as you deserve to be. But you will read
      this with disdain, as mere idle words: so be it. Farewell! HELEN STANLEY.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next, she was to write to Beauclerc himself. Her letter was as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With my whole heart, dear Granville, I thank you for the generous
      confidence you have shown towards me, and for the invariable steadiness of
      your faith and love. For your sake, I rejoice. One good has at least
      resulted from the trials you have gone through: you must now and hereafter
      feel sure of your own strength of mind. With me it has been different, for
      I have not a strong mind. I have been all weakness, and must now be
      miserable; but wicked I will not be&mdash;and wicked I should be if I took
      advantage of your confiding love. I must disappoint your affection, but
      your confidence I will not betray. When I put your love to that test which
      it has so nobly stood, I had hoped that a time would come when all doubts
      would be cleared up, and when I could reward your constancy by the
      devotion of my whole happy life&mdash;but that hope is past: I cannot
      prove my innocence&mdash;I will no longer allow you to take it upon my
      assertion. I cannot indeed, with truth, even assert that I have done no
      wrong; for though I am not false, I have gone on step by step in
      deception, and might go on, I know not how far, nor to what dreadful
      consequences, if I did not now stop&mdash;and I do stop. On my own head be
      the penalty of my fault&mdash;upon my own happiness&mdash;my own
      character: I will not involve yours&mdash;therefore we part. You have not
      yet heard all that has been said of me; but you soon will, and you will
      feel, as I do, that I am not fit to be your wife. Your wife should not be
      suspected; I have been&mdash;I am. All the happiness I can ever have in
      this world must be henceforth in the thought of having saved from misery&mdash;if
      not secured the happiness of those I love. Leave me this hope&mdash;Oh,
      Granville, do not tell me, do not make me believe that you will never be
      happy without me! You will&mdash;indeed you will. I only pray Heaven that
      you may find love as true as mine, and strength to abide by the truth! Do
      not write to me&mdash;do not try to persuade me to change my
      determination: it is irrevocable. Further writing or meeting could be only
      useless anguish to us both. Give me the sole consolation I can now have,
      and which you alone can give&mdash;let me hear from Cecilia that you and
      your noble-minded guardian are, after I am gone, as good friends as you
      were before you knew me. I shall be gone from this house before you are
      here again; I cannot stay where I can do no good, and might do much evil
      by remaining even a few hours longer. As it is, comfort your generous
      heart on my account, with the assurance that I am sustained by the
      consciousness that I am now, to the best of my power, doing right. Adieu,
      Granville! Be happy! you can&mdash;you have done no wrong. Be happy, and
      that will console
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your affectionate HELEN STANLEY.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This, enclosed to General Clarendon, she sent by Cockburn, who delivered
      it to his master immediately. Though she could perfectly depend upon her
      maid Rose&rsquo;s fidelity, Helen did not tell her that she was going away in
      the morning, to avoid bringing her into any difficulty if she were
      questioned by Lady Cecilia; and besides, no note of preparation would be
      heard or seen. She would take with her only sufficient for the day, and
      would leave Rose to pack up all that belonged to her, after her departure,
      and to follow her. Thanks to her own late discretion, she had no money
      difficulties&mdash;no debts but such as Rose could settle, and she had now
      only to write to Cecilia; but she had not yet recovered from the tumult of
      mind which the writing to the general and to Beauclerc had caused. She lay
      down upon the sofa, and closing her trembling eyelids, she tried to
      compose herself sufficiently to think at least of what she was to say. As
      she passed the table in going to the sofa, she, without perceiving it,
      threw down some of the flowers; they caught her eye, and she said to
      herself &ldquo;Lie there! lie there! Granville&rsquo;s last gifts! last gifts to me!
      All over now; lie there and wither! Joys that are passed, wither! All
      happiness for me, gone! Lie there, and wither, and die!&mdash;and so shall
      I soon, I hope&mdash;if that only hope is not wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some one knocked at the door; she started up, and said, &ldquo;I cannot see you,
      Cecilia!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A voice not Cecilia&rsquo;s, a voice she did not recollect, answered, &ldquo;It is not
      Cecilia; let me see you. I come from General Clarendon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen opened the door, and saw&mdash;Miss Clarendon. Her voice had sounded
      so much lower and gentler than usual, that Helen had not guessed it to be
      hers. She was cloaked, as if prepared to go away; and in the outer room
      was another lady seated with her back towards them, and with her cloak on
      also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My aunt Pennant&mdash;who will wait for me. As she is a stranger, she
      would not intrude upon you, Miss Stanley; but will you allow me one
      minute?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen, surprised, begged Miss Clarendon to come in, moved a chair towards
      her, and stood breathless with anxiety. Miss Clarendon sat down, and
      resuming her abruptness of tone, said, &ldquo;I feel that I have no right to
      expect that you should have confidence in me, and yet I do. I believe in
      your sincerity, even from the little I know of you, and I have a notion
      you believe in mine. Do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish it had pleased Heaven,&rdquo; continued Miss Clarendon, &ldquo;that my brother
      had married a woman who could speak truth! But you need not be afraid; I
      will not touch on your secrets. On any matter you have in keeping, my
      honour as well as yours will command my silence&mdash;as will also my
      brother&rsquo;s happiness, which I have somewhat at heart; not that I think it
      can be preserved by the means you take. But this is not what I came to
      say. You mean to go away from this house to-morrow morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right. I would not stay where I did not esteem or where I had
      reason to believe that I was not esteemed. You are quite right to go, and
      to go directly; but not to your old housekeeper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, though I dare say she is vastly respectable,&mdash;an excellent
      person in her way, I am convinced,&mdash;yet my brother says she might not
      be thought just the sort of person to whom you should go now&mdash;not
      just the thing for you at present; though, at another time, it would be
      very well and condescending; but now, when you are attacked, you must look
      to appearances&mdash;in short, my brother will not allow you to go to this
      old lady&rsquo;s boarding-house, or cottage, or whatever it may be, at Seven
      Oaks; he must be able to say for you where you are gone. You must be with
      me; you must be at Llansillen. Llansillen is a place that can be named.
      You must be with me&mdash;with General Clarendon&rsquo;s sister. You must&mdash;you
      will, I am sure, my dear Miss Stanley. I never was so happy in having a
      house of my own as at this moment. You will not refuse to return with my
      aunt and me to Llansillen, and make our home yours? We will try and make
      it a happy home to you. Try; you see the sense of it: the world can say
      nothing when you are known to be with Miss Clarendon; and you will, I
      hope, feel the comfort of it, out of the stir and din of this London
      world. I know you like the country, and Llansillen is a beautiful place&mdash;romantic
      too; a fine castle, an excellent library, beautiful conservatory; famous
      for our conservatories we are in South Wales; and no neighbours&mdash;singular
      blessing! And my aunt Pennant, you will love her so! Will you try? Come!
      say that you will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Helen could not; she could only press the hand that Miss Clarendon
      held out to her. There is nothing more touching, more overcoming, than
      kindness at the moment the heart is sunk in despair. &ldquo;But did General
      Clarendon really wish you to ask me?&rdquo; said Helen, when she could speak.
      &ldquo;Did he think so much and so carefully for me to the last? And with such a
      bad opinion as he must have of me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there you know he is wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is like himself,&rdquo; continued Helen; &ldquo;consistent in protecting me to the
      last. Oh, to lose such a friend!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not lost, only mislaid,&rdquo; said Miss Clarendon. &ldquo;You will find him again
      some fair day or other; truth always comes to light. Meanwhile, all is
      settled. I must run and tell my aunt, and bless the fates and Lady Emily
      Greville, that Lady Cecilia did not come up in the middle of it. Luckily,
      she thinks I am gone, and knows nothing of my being with you; for my
      brother explained all this to me in his study, after we had left the
      saloon, and he desires me to say that his carriage shall be ready for you
      at your hour, at eight o&rsquo;clock. We shall expect you; and now, farewell
      till to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was gone, and her motto might well be, though in a different
      acceptation from that of our greatest modern politician&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Tout
      faire sans paraître.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But before Helen could go to rest, she must write to Lady Cecilia, and her
      thoughts were in such perplexity, and her feelings in such conflict, that
      she knew not how to begin. At last she wrote only a few hasty lines of
      farewell, and referred for her determination, and for all explanations, to
      her letter to the general. It came to &ldquo;Farewell, dear Cecilia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dear! yes, still dear she was to Helen&mdash;she must be as Lady
      Davenant&rsquo;s daughter&mdash;still dear for her own sake was Cecilia, the
      companion of her childhood, who had shown her such generous affection
      early, such fondness always, who was so charming, with so many good
      qualities, so much to win love&mdash;loved she must be still. &ldquo;Farewell,
      Cecilia; may you be happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But as Helen wrote these words, she thought it impossible, she could
      scarcely in the present circumstances wish it possible, that Cecilia
      should be happy. How could she, unless her conscience had become quite
      callous?
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave her note to Rose, with orders to deliver it herself to Lady
      Cecilia to-night, when she should demand admittance. And soon she came,
      the very instant Lady Emily Greville went away&mdash;before Helen was in
      bed she heard Cecilia at her door; she left her to parley with Rose&mdash;heard
      her voice in the first instance eager, peremptory for admittance. Then a
      sudden silence. Helen comprehended that she had opened her note&mdash;and
      in another instant she heard her retreating step. On seeing the first
      words referring for explanation to Helen&rsquo;s letter to the general,
      panic-struck, Lady Cecilia hurried to her own room to read the rest
      privately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen now tried to recollect whether every thing had been said, written,
      done, that ought to be done; and at last went to bed and endeavoured to
      sleep for a few hours.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Helen was just dressed, and had given her last orders to her bewildered
      maid, when she heard a knock at the door, and Mademoiselle Felicie&rsquo;s
      voice. She could not at this instant endure to hear her heartless
      exclamatory speeches; she would not admit her. Mademoiselle Felicie gave
      Rose a note for her young lady&mdash;it was from Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest Helen,&mdash;The general will not allow me to take leave of you
      this morning, but I shall certainly go to you in the course of to-day. I
      cannot understand or make you understand any thing till I see you. I <i>will</i>
      see you to-day. Your affectionate CECILIA.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand it too well!&rdquo; thought Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage was announced, Helen was ready; she hurried into it, and she
      was gone! And thus she parted from the friend of her childhood&mdash;the
      friend she had but a few months before met with such joy, such true
      affection; and her own affection was true to the last.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Helen drove from the door, she saw the general&mdash;yes, it certainly
      was the general riding off&mdash;at this unusual hour!&mdash;Was it to
      avoid her? But she was in too great anguish to dwell upon that or any
      other circumstance; her only thought now was to subdue her emotion before
      she was seen by Miss Clarendon and Mrs. Pennant. And by the time she
      arrived, she thought she had quite recovered herself, and was not aware
      that any traces of tears remained; but to Mrs. Pennant&rsquo;s sympathising eyes
      they were visible, and after the first introductions and salutations were
      over, that kind lady, as she seated her at the breakfast-table, gently
      pressing her hand, said, &ldquo;Poor thing! no wonder&mdash;parting with old
      friends for new is a sad trial: but you know we shall become old friends
      in time: we will make what haste we can, my dear Miss Stanley, and Esther
      will help me to make you forget that you have not known us all your life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is very little to be known; no mysteries, that is one comfort,&rdquo;
       said Miss Clarendon; &ldquo;so now to breakfast. You are very punctual, Miss
      Stanley; and that is a virtue which aunt Pennant likes, and can estimate
      to a fraction of a minute with that excellent watch of hers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was some history belonging to that family-watch, which then came
      out; and then the conversation turned upon little family anecdotes and
      subjects which were naturally interesting to the aunt and niece, and not
      exciting to Helen, whose mind, they saw, needed quiet, and freedom from
      all observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the first awkwardness of her situation, from the sense of intrusion,
      and the suddenness of change, she was thus as far as possible gradually
      and almost imperceptibly relieved. By their perfect good-breeding, as well
      as good-nature, from their making no effort to show her particular
      attention, she felt received at once into their family as one of
      themselves; and yet, though there was no effort, she perceived in the most
      minute circumstances the same sort of consideration which would be shown
      to an intimate friend. They not only did not expect, but did not wish,
      that she should make any exertion to appear to be what she could not be;
      they knew the loneliness of heart she must feel, the weight that must be
      upon her spirits. They left her, then, quite at liberty to be with them or
      alone, as she might like, and she was glad to be alone with her own
      thoughts; they soon fixed upon Beauclerc. She considered how he would
      feel, what he would think, when he should receive her letter: she pictured
      his looks while reading it; considered whether he would write immediately,
      or attempt, notwithstanding her prohibition, to see her. He would know
      from General Clarendon, that is, if the general thought proper to tell
      him, where she was, and that she would remain all this day in town. Though
      her determination was fixed, whether he wrote or came, to abide by her
      refusal, and for the unanswerable reasons which she had given, or which
      she had laid down to herself; yet she could not, and who, loving as she
      did, could help wishing that Beauclerc should desire to see her again; she
      hoped that he would make every effort to change her resolution, even
      though it might cost them both pain. Yet in some pain there is pleasure;
      or, to be without it, is a worse kind of suffering. Helen was conscious of
      the inconsistency in her mind, and sighed, and endeavoured to be
      reasonable. And, to do her justice, there was not the slightest wavering
      as to the main point. She thought that the general might, perhaps, have
      some relenting towards her. Hope would come into her mind, though she
      tried to keep it out; she had nothing to expect, she repeatedly said to
      herself, except that either Cecilia would send, or the general would call
      this morning, and Rose must come at all events.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning passed on, however, and no one came so soon as Helen had
      expected. She was sitting in a back room where no knocks at the door could
      be heard; but she would have been called, surely, if General Clarendon had
      come. He had come, but he had not asked for her; he had at first inquired
      only for his sister, but she was not at home, gone to the dentist&rsquo;s. The
      general then desired to see Mrs. Pennant, and when she supposed that she
      had not heard rightly, and that Miss Stanley must be the person he wished
      to see, he had answered, &ldquo;By no means; I particularly wish not to see Miss
      Stanley. I beg to see Mrs. Pennant alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It fell to the lot of this gentle-hearted lady to communicate to Helen the
      dreadful intelligence he brought: a duel had taken place! When Helen had
      seen the general riding off, he was on his way to Chalk Farm. Just as the
      carriage was coming round for Miss Stanley, Mr. Beauclerc&rsquo;s groom had
      requested in great haste to see the general; he said he was sure something
      was going wrong about his master; he had heard the words Chalk Farm. The
      general was off instantly, but before he reached the spot the duel had
      been fought. A duel between Beauclerc and Mr. Churchill. Beauclerc was
      safe, but Mr. Churchill was dangerously wounded; the medical people
      present could not answer for his life. At the time the general saw him he
      was speechless, but when Beauclerc and his second, Lord Beltravers, had
      come up to him, he had extended his hand in token of forgiveness to one or
      the other, but to which he had addressed the only words he had uttered
      could not be ascertained; the words were, &ldquo;<i>You</i> are not to blame!&mdash;escape!&mdash;fly!&rdquo;
       Both had fled to the Continent. General Clarendon said that he had no time
      for explanations, he had not been able to get any intelligible account of
      the cause of the affair. Lord Beltravers had named Miss Stanley, but
      Beauclerc had stopped him, and had expressed the greatest anxiety that
      Miss Stanley&rsquo;s name should not be implicated, should not be mentioned. He
      took the whole blame upon himself&mdash;said he would write&mdash;there
      was no time for more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pennant listened with the dread of losing a single word: but however
      brief his expressions, the general&rsquo;s manner of speaking, notwithstanding
      the intensity of his emotion, was so distinct that every word was audible,
      except the name of Lord Beltravers, which was not familiar to her. She
      asked again the name of Mr. Beauclerc&rsquo;s second? &ldquo;Lord Beltravers,&rdquo; the
      general repeated with a forcible accent, and loosening his neck-cloth with
      his finger, he added, &ldquo;Rascal! as I always told Beauclerc that he was, and
      so he will find him&mdash;too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Except this exacerbation, the general was calmly reserved in speech, and
      Mrs. Pennant felt that she could not ask him a single question beyond what
      he had communicated. When he rose to go, which he did the moment he had
      finished what he had to say, she had, however, courage enough to hope that
      they should soon hear again, when the general should learn something more
      of Mr. Churchill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly he would let her know whatever he could learn of Mr. Churchill&rsquo;s
      state.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes followed him to the door with anxious eagerness to penetrate
      farther into what his own opinion of the danger might be. His rigidity of
      composure made her fear that he had no hope, &ldquo;otherwise certainly he would
      have said something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened the door again, and returning, said, &ldquo;Depend upon it you shall
      hear how he is, my dear Mrs. Pennant, before you leave town to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will not go to-morrow,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;We will stay another day at
      least. Poor Miss Stanley will be so anxious&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I advise you not to stay in town another day, my dear madam. You can do
      no good by it. If Mr. Churchill survive this day, he will linger long I am
      assured. Take Helen&mdash;take Miss Stanley out of town, as soon as may
      be. Better go to-morrow, as you had determined.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it will be so long, my dear general!&mdash;one moment&mdash;if we go,
      it will be so long before we can hear any further news of your ward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will write.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Miss Stanley&mdash;Oh, thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To my sister,&rdquo; he looked back to say, and repeated distinctly, &ldquo;To my
      sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well&mdash;thank you, at all events.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pennant saw that, in General Clarendon&rsquo;s present disposition towards
      Miss Stanley, the less she said of him the better, and she confined
      herself strictly to what she had been commissioned to say, and all she
      could do was to prevent the added pain of suspense; it was told to Helen
      in the simplest shortest manner possible:&mdash;but the facts were
      dreadful. Beauclerc was safe!&mdash;safe! but under what circumstances?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it was for me, I am sure,&rdquo; cried Helen, &ldquo;I am sure it was for me! I
      was the cause! I am the cause of that man&rsquo;s death&mdash;of Beauclerc&rsquo;s
      agony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For some time Helen had not power or thought for any other idea. The
      promise that they should hear as soon as they could learn any thing more
      of Mr. Churchill&rsquo;s state was all she could rely upon or recur to.
    </p>
    <p>
      When her maid Rose arrived from General Clarendon&rsquo;s, she said, that when
      Lady Cecilia heard of the duel she had been taken very ill, but had since
      recovered sufficiently to drive out with the general. Miss Clarendon
      assured Helen there was no danger. &ldquo;It is too deep a misfortune for Lady
      Cecilia. Her feelings have not depth enough for it, you will see. You need
      not be afraid for her, Helen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The circumstances which led to the duel were not clearly known till long
      afterwards, but may be now related. The moment Beauclerc had parted from
      Helen when he turned away at the carriage door after the party at Lady
      Castlefort&rsquo;s he went in search of one, who, as he hoped, could explain the
      strange whispers he had heard. The person of whom he went in search was
      his friend, his friend as he deemed him, Lord Beltravers. Churchill had
      suggested that if any body knew the bottom of the matter, except that
      origin of all evil Lady Katrine herself,&mdash;it must be Lord Beltravers,
      with whom Lady Castlefort was, it was said, <i>fortement éprise</i>, and
      as Horace observed, &ldquo;the secrets of scandal are common property between
      lovers, much modern love being cemented by hate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without taking in the full force of this observation in its particular
      application to the hatred which Lord Beltravers might feel to Miss
      Stanley, as the successful rival of his sister Blanche, Beauclerc hastened
      to act upon his suggestion. His lordship was not at home: his people
      thought he had been at Lady Castlefort&rsquo;s; did not know where he might be
      if not there. At some gambling-house Beauclerc at last found him, and Lord
      Beltravers was sufficiently vexed in the first place at being there found,
      for he had pretended to his friend Granville that he no longer played. His
      embarrassment was increased by the questions which Beauclerc so suddenly
      put to him; but he had <i>nonchalante</i> impudence enough to brave it
      through, and he depended with good reason on Beauclerc&rsquo;s prepossession in
      his favour. He protested he knew nothing about it; and he returned
      Churchill&rsquo;s charge, by throwing the whole blame upon him; said he knew he
      was in league with Lady Katrine;&mdash;mentioned that one morning,
      sometime ago, he had dropped in unexpectedly early at Lady Castlefort&rsquo;s,
      and had been surprised to find the two sisters, contrary to their wont,
      together&mdash;their heads and Horace Churchill&rsquo;s over some manuscript,
      which was shuffled away as he entered. This was true, all but the
      shuffling away; and here it is necessary to form a clear notion, clearer
      than Lord Beltravers will give, of the different shares of wrong; of wrong
      knowingly and unknowingly perpetrated by the several scandal-mongers
      concerned in this affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Beltravers could be in no doubt as to his own share, for he it was
      who had furnished the editor of Colonel D&rsquo;Aubigny&rsquo;s Memoirs with the
      famous letters. When Carlos, Lady Davenant&rsquo;s runaway page, escaped from
      Clarendon Park, having changed his name, he got into the service of Sir
      Thomas D&rsquo;Aubigny, who was just at this time arranging his brother&rsquo;s
      papers. Now it had happened that Carlos had been concealed behind the
      screen in Lady Davenant&rsquo;s room, the day of her first conversation with
      Helen about Colonel D&rsquo;Aubigny, and he had understood enough of it to
      perceive that there was some mystery about the colonel with either Helen
      or Lady Cecilia; and chancing one day, soon after he entered Sir Thomas&rsquo;s
      service, to find his escritoire open, he amused himself with looking over
      his papers, among which he discovered the packet of Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s
      letters. Carlos was not perfectly sure of the handwriting; he thought it
      was Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s; but when he found the miniature of Miss Stanley along
      with them, he concluded that the letters must be hers. And having special
      reasons for feeling vengeance against Helen, and certain at all events of
      doing mischief, he sent them to General Clarendon: not, however,
      forgetting his old trade, he copied them first. This was just at the time
      when Lord Beltravers returned from abroad after his sister&rsquo;s divorce. He
      by some accident found out who Carlos was, and whence he came, and full of
      his own views for his sister, he cross-examined him as to every thing he
      knew about Miss Stanley; and partly by bribes, partly by threats of
      betraying him to Lady Davenant, he contrived to get from him the copied
      letters. Carlos soon after returned with his master to Portugal, and was
      never more heard of. Lord Beltravers took these purloined copies of the
      letters, thus surreptitiously obtained, to the editor, into whose hands
      Sir Thomas D&rsquo;Aubigny (who knew nothing of books or book-making) had put
      his brother&rsquo;s memoirs. This editor, as has been mentioned, had previously
      consulted Mr. Churchill, and in consequence of his pepper and salt hint,
      Lord Beltravers himself made those interpolations which he hoped would
      ruin his sister&rsquo;s rival in the eyes of her lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Churchill, however, except this hint, and except his vanity in
      furnishing a good title, and his coxcombry of literary patronage, and his
      general hope that Helen&rsquo;s name being implicated in such a publication
      would avenge her rejection of himself, had had nothing to do with the
      business. This Lord Beltravers well knew, and yet when he found that the
      slander made no impression upon Beauclerc, and that he was only intent
      upon discovering the slanderer, he, with dexterous treachery, contrived to
      turn the tables upon Churchill, and to direct all Beauclerc&rsquo;s suspicion
      towards him! He took his friend home with him, and showed him all the
      newspaper paragraphs&mdash;paragraphs which he himself had written! Yes,
      this man of romantic friendship, this blazé, this hero oppressed with his
      own sensibility, could condescend to write anonymous scandal, to league
      with newsmongers, and to bribe waiting-women to supply him with
      information, for Mademoiselle Felicie had, through Lady Katrine&rsquo;s maid,
      told all, and more than all she knew, of what passed at General
      Clarendon&rsquo;s; and on this foundation did he construct those paragraphs,
      which he hoped would blast the character of the woman to whom his dearest
      friend was engaged. And now he contrived to say all that could convince
      Beauclerc that Mr. Churchill was the author of these very paragraphs. And
      hot and rash, Beauclerc rushed on to that conclusion. He wrote, a
      challenge to Churchill, and as soon as it was possible in the morning he
      sent it by Lord Beltravers. Mr. Churchill named Sir John Luttrell as his
      friend: Lord Beltravers would enter into no terms of accommodation; the
      challenge was accepted, Chalk Farm appointed as the place of meeting, and
      the time fixed for eight o&rsquo;clock next morning. And thus, partly by his own
      warmth of temper, and partly by the falsehood of others, was Beauclerc
      urged on to the action he detested, to be the thing he hated. Duelling and
      duellists had, from the time he could think, been his abhorrence, and now
      he was to end his life, or to take the life of a fellow-creature perhaps,
      in a duel.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a dread interval. And it was during the remainder of this day
      and night that Beauclerc felt most strongly compared with all other
      earthly ties, his attachment, his passionate love for Helen. At every
      pause, at every close of other thoughts forced upon him, his mind recurred
      to Helen&mdash;what Helen would feel&mdash;what Helen would think&mdash;what
      she would suffer&mdash;and in the most and in the least important things
      his care was for her. He recalled the last look that he had seen at the
      carriage-door when they parted, recollected that it expressed anxiety, was
      conscious that he had turned away abruptly&mdash;that in the preoccupied
      state of his mind he had not spoken one word of kindness&mdash;and that
      this might be the last impression of him left on her mind. He knew that
      her anxiety would increase, when all that day must pass without his
      return, and it was then he thought of sending her those flowers which
      would, he knew, reassure her better than any words he could venture to
      write.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile his false friend coldly calculated what were the chances in his
      sister&rsquo;s favour; and when Churchill fell, and even in the hurry of their
      immediate departure, Lord Beltravers wrote to Madame de St. Cymon, over
      whom the present state of her affairs gave him command, to order her to
      set out immediately, and to take Blanche with her to Paris, without asking
      the consent of that fool and prude, her aunt Lady Grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was well for poor Helen, even in the dreadful uncertainty in which she
      left London, that she did not know <i>all</i> these circumstances. It may
      be doubted, indeed, whether we should be altogether happier in this life
      if that worst of evils, as it is often called, suspense, were absolutely
      annihilated, and if human creatures could clearly see their fate, or even
      know what is most likely to happen.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      According to the general&rsquo;s advice, Mrs. Pennant did not delay her journey,
      and Helen left London the next day with her and Miss Clarendon. The last
      bulletin of Mr. Churchill had been that he was still in great danger, and
      a few scarce legible lines Helen had received from Cecilia, saying that
      the general would not allow her to agitate herself by going to take leave
      of her, that she was glad that Helen was to be out of town till all blew
      over, and that she was so much distracted by this horrible event, she
      scarcely knew what she wrote.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they drove out of town, Miss Clarendon, in hopes of turning Helen&rsquo;s
      thoughts, went on talking. &ldquo;Unless,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;we could like Madame de
      Genlis, &lsquo;promote the post-boys into agents of mystery and romance,&rsquo; we
      have but little chance, I am afraid, of any adventures on our journey to
      Llansillen, my dear Miss Stanley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She inveighed against the stupid safety, convenience, luxury, and
      expedition of travelling now-a-days all over England, even in Wales, &ldquo;so
      that one might sleep the whole way from Hyde Park corner to Llansillen
      gate,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and have no unconscionably long nap either. No
      difficulties on the road, nothing to complain of at inns, no enjoying
      one&rsquo;s dear delight in being angry, no opportunity even of showing one&rsquo;s
      charming resignation. Dreadfully bad this for the nervous and bilious, for
      all the real use and benefit of travelling is done away; all too easy for
      my taste; one might as well be a doll, or a dolt, or a parcel in the
      coach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen would have been glad to have been considered merely as a parcel in
      the coach. During the whole journey, she took no notice of any thing till
      they came within a few miles of Llansillen; then, endeavouring to
      sympathise with her companions, she looked out of the carriage window at
      the prospect which they admired. But, however charming, Llansillen had not
      for Helen the chief charm of early, fond, old associations with a happy
      home. To her it was to be, she doubted not, as happy as kindness could
      make it, but still it was new; and in that thought, that feeling, there
      was something inexpressibly melancholy; and the contrast, at this moment,
      between her sensations and those of her companions, made the pain the more
      poignant; they perceived this, and were silent. Helen was grateful for
      this consideration for her, but she could not bear to be a constraint upon
      them, therefore she now exerted herself, sat forward&mdash;admired and
      talked when she was scarcely able to speak. By the time they came to
      Llansillen gate, however, she could say no more; she was obliged to
      acknowledge that she was not well; and when the carriage at last stopped
      at the door, there was such a throbbing in her temples, and she was
      altogether so ill, that it was with the greatest difficulty she could,
      leaning on Miss Clarendon&rsquo;s arm, mount the high steps to the hall-door.
      She could scarcely stand when she reached the top, but, making an effort,
      she went on, crossed the slippery floor of that great hall, and came to
      the foot of the black oak staircase, of which the steps were so very low
      that she thought she could easily go up, but found it impossible, and she
      was carried directly up to Miss Clarendon&rsquo;s own room, no other having been
      yet prepared. The rosy Welsh maids looked with pity on the pale stranger.
      They hurried to and fro, talking Welsh to one another very fast; and Helen
      felt as if she were in a foreign land, and in a dream. The end of the
      matter was, that she had a low fever which lasted long. It was more
      dispiriting than dangerous&mdash;more tedious than alarming. Her illness
      continued for many weeks, during which time she was attended most
      carefully by her two new friends&mdash;by Miss Clarendon with the utmost
      zeal and activity&mdash;by Mrs. Pennant with the greatest solicitude and
      tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her history for these weeks&mdash;indeed for some months afterwards&mdash;can
      be only the diary of an invalid and of a convalescent. Miss Clarendon
      meanwhile received from her brother, punctually, once a week, bulletins of
      Churchill&rsquo;s health; the surgical details, the fears of the formation of
      internal abscess, reports of continual exfoliations of bone, were
      judiciously suppressed, and the laconic general reported only &ldquo;Much the
      same&mdash;not progressing&mdash;cannot be pronounced out of danger.&rdquo;
       These bulletins were duly repeated to Helen, whenever she was able to hear
      them; and at last she was considered well enough to read various letters,
      which had arrived for her during her illness; several were from Lady
      Cecilia, but little in them. The first was full only of expressions of
      regret, and self-reproach; in the last, she said, <i>she hoped soon to
      have a right to claim Helen back again</i>. This underlined passage Helen
      knew alluded to the promise she had once made, that at the birth of her
      child all should be told; but words of promise from Cecilia had lost all
      value&mdash;all power to excite even hope, as she said to herself as she
      read the words, and sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of her letters mentioned what she would have seen in the first
      newspaper she had opened, that Lady Blanche Forrester was gone with her
      sister, the Comtesse de St. Cymon, to Paris, to join her brother Lord
      Beltravers. But Lady Cecilia observed, that Helen need not be alarmed by
      this paragraph, which she was sure was inserted on purpose to plague her.
      Lady Cecilia seemed to take it for granted that her rejection of Beauclerc
      was only a <i>ruse d&rsquo;amour</i>, and went on with her usual hopes, now
      vague and more vague every letter&mdash;that things would end well
      sometime, somehow or other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen only sighed on reading these letters, and quick as she glanced her
      eye over them, threw them from her on the bed; and Miss Clarendon said,
      &ldquo;Ay! you know her now, I see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen made no reply: she was careful not to make any comment which could
      betray how much, or what sort of reason she had to complain of Lady
      Cecilia; but Miss Clarendon, confident that she had guessed pretty nearly
      the truth, was satisfied with her own penetration, and then, after seeming
      to doubt for a few moments, she put another letter into Helen&rsquo;s hand, and
      with one of those looks of tender interest which sometimes softened her
      countenance, she left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter was from Beauclerc; it appeared to have been written
      immediately after he had received Helen&rsquo;s letter, and was as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not write to you, my dearest Helen! Renounce my claim to your hand!
      submit to be rejected by you, my affianced bride! No, never&mdash;never!
      Doubt! suspicion!&mdash;suspicion of you!&mdash;you, angel as you are&mdash;you,
      who have devoted, sacrificed yourself to others. No, Helen, my admiration,
      my love, my trust in you, are greater than they ever were. And do <i>I</i>
      dare to say these words to you? <i>I</i>, who am perhaps a murderer! I
      ought to imitate your generosity, I ought not to offer you a hand stained
      with blood:&mdash;I ought at least to leave you free till I know when I
      may return from banishment. I have written this at the first instant I
      have been able to command during my hurried journey, and as you know
      something of what led to this unhappy business, you shall in my next
      letter hear the whole; till then, adieu! GRANVILLE BEAUCLERC.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next day, when she thought Helen sufficiently recovered from the
      agitation of reading Beauclerc&rsquo;s letter, aunt Pennant produced one letter
      more, which she had kept for the last, because she hoped it would give
      pleasure to her patient. Helen sat up in her bed eagerly, and stretched
      out her hand. The letter was directed by General Clarendon, but that was
      only the outer cover, they knew, for he had mentioned in his last dispatch
      to his sister, that the letter enclosed for Miss Stanley was from Lady
      Davenant. Helen tore off the cover, but the instant she saw the inner
      direction, she sank hack, turned, and hid her face on the pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was directed&mdash;&ldquo;To Mrs. Granville Beauclerc.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Davenant had unfortunately taken it for granted, that nothing could
      have prevented the marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Pennant blamed herself for not having foreseen, and prevented this
      accident, which she saw distressed poor Helen so much. But Miss Clarendon
      wondered that she was so shocked, and supposed she would get over it in a
      few minutes, or else she must be very weak. There was nothing that tended
      to raise her spirits much in the letter itself, to make amends for the
      shock the direction had given. It contained but a few lines in Lady
      Davenant&rsquo;s own handwriting, and a postscript from Lord Davenant. She wrote
      only to announce their safe arrival at Petersburgh, as she was obliged to
      send off her letter before she had received any dispatches from England;
      and she concluded with, &ldquo;I am sure the first will bring me the joyful news
      of Beauclerc&rsquo;s happiness and yours, my dear child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Davenant&rsquo;s postscript added, that in truth Lady Davenant much needed
      such a cordial, for that her health had suffered even more than he had
      feared it would. He repented that he had allowed her to accompany him to
      such a rigorous climate.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that could be said to allay the apprehensions this postscript might
      excite, was of course said in the best way by aunt Pennant. But it was
      plain that Helen did not recover during the whole of this day from the
      shock she had felt &ldquo;from that foolish direction,&rdquo; as Miss Clarendon said.
      She could not be prevailed upon to rise this day, though Miss Clarendon,
      after feeling her pulse, had declared that she was very well able to get
      up. &ldquo;It was very bad for her to remain in bed.&rdquo; This was true, no doubt.
      And Miss Clarendon remarked to her aunt that she was surprised to find
      Miss Stanley so weak. Her aunt replied that it was not surprising that she
      should be rather weak at present, after such a long illness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weakness of body and mind need not go together,&rdquo; said Miss Clarendon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Need not, perhaps,&rdquo; said her aunt, &ldquo;but they are apt to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is to be hoped the weakness of mind will go with the weakness of body,
      and soon,&rdquo; said Miss Clarendon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must do what we can to strengthen and fatten her, poor thing!&rdquo; said
      Mrs. Pennant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fatten the body, rather easier than to strengthen the mind. Strength of
      mind cannot be thrown in, as you would throw in the bark, or the chicken
      broth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only have patience with her,&rdquo; said Mrs. Pennant, &ldquo;and you will find that
      she will have strength of mind enough when she gets quite well. Only have
      patience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During Helen&rsquo;s illness Miss Clarendon had been patient, but now that she
      was pronounced convalescent, she became eager to see her quite well. In
      time of need Miss Clarendon had been not only the most active and zealous,
      but a most gentle and&mdash;doubt it who may&mdash;soft-stepping,
      soft-voiced nurse; but now, when Doctor Tudor had assured them that all
      fever was gone, and agreed with her that the patient would soon be well,
      if she would only think so, Miss Clarendon deemed it high time to use
      something more than her milder influence, to become, if not a rugged, at
      least a stern nurse, and she brought out some of her rigid lore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I intend that you should get up in seasonable time to-day, Helen,&rdquo; said
      she, as she entered her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; said Helen in a languid voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Miss Clarendon; &ldquo;and I hope you do not intend to do as you
      did yesterday, to lie in bed all day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen turned, sighed, and Mrs. Pennant said, &ldquo;Yesterday is over, my dear
      Esther&mdash;no use in talking of yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only to secure our doing better to-day, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; replied Miss Clarendon
      with prompt ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen was all submission, and she got up, and that was well. Miss
      Clarendon went in quest of arrow-root judiciously; and aunt Pennant stayed
      and nourished her patient meanwhile with &ldquo;the fostering dew of praise;&rdquo;
       and let her dress as slowly and move as languidly as she liked, though
      Miss Clarendon had admonished her &ldquo;not to <i>dawdle</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as she was dressed, Helen went to the window and threw up the sash
      for the first time to enjoy the fresh air, and to see the prospect which
      she was told was beautiful; and she saw that it was beautiful, and, though
      it was still winter, she felt that the air was balmy; and the sun shone
      bright, and the grass began to be green, for spring approached. But how
      different to her from the spring-time of former years! Nature the same,
      but all within herself how changed! And all which used to please, and to
      seem to her most cheerful, now came over her spirits with a sense of
      sadness;&mdash;she felt as if all the life of life was gone. Tears filled
      her eyes, large tears rolled slowly down as she stood fixed, seeming to
      gaze from that window at she knew not what. Aunt Pennant unperceived stood
      beside her, and let the tears flow unnoticed. &ldquo;They will do her good; they
      are a great relief sometimes.&rdquo; Miss Clarendon returned, and the tears were
      dried, but the glaze remained, and Miss Clarendon saw it, and gave a
      reproachful look at her aunt, as much as to say, &ldquo;Why did you let her
      cry?&rdquo; And her aunt&rsquo;s look in reply was, &ldquo;I could not help it, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eat your arrow-root,&rdquo; was all that transpired to Helen. And she tried to
      eat, but could not; and Miss Clarendon was not well pleased, for the
      arrow-root was good, and she had made it; she felt Miss Stanley&rsquo;s pulse,
      and said that &ldquo;It was as good a pulse as could be, only low and a little
      fluttered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not flutter it any more, then, Esther my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Pennant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What am I doing or saying, ma&rsquo;am, that should flutter anybody that has
      common sense?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some people don&rsquo;t like to have their pulse felt,&rdquo; said aunt Pennant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those people have not common sense,&rdquo; replied the niece.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I have not common sense,&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sense you have enough&mdash;resolution is what you want, Helen, I tell
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;too true&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, but not too true&mdash;nothing can be too true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Helen, with languid submission. Helen was not in a condition
      to chop logic, or ever much inclined to it; now less than ever, and least
      of all with Miss Clarendon, so able as she was. There is something very
      provoking sometimes in perfect submission, because it is unanswerable. But
      the langour, not the submission, afforded some cause for further remark
      and remonstrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen, you are dreadfully languid to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sadly,&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you could have eaten more arrow-root before it grew cold, you would
      have been better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if she could not, my dear Esther,&rdquo; said aunt Pennant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Could</i> not, ma&rsquo;am! As if people could not eat if they pleased.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if people have no appetite, my dear, I am afraid eating will not do
      much good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid, my dear aunt, you will not do Miss Stanley much good,&rdquo; said
      Miss Clarendon, shaking her head; &ldquo;you will only spoil her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite spoiled, I believe,&rdquo; said Helen; &ldquo;you must unspoil me,
      Esther.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so very easy,&rdquo; said Esther; &ldquo;but I shall try, for I am a sincere
      friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure of it,&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then what more could be said? Nothing at that time&mdash;Helen&rsquo;s look was
      so sincerely grateful, and &ldquo;gentle as a lamb,&rdquo; as aunt Pennant observed;
      and Esther was not a wolf quite&mdash;at heart not at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Clarendon presently remarked that Miss Stanley really did not seem
      glad to be better&mdash;glad to get well. Helen acknowledged that instead
      of being glad, she was rather sorry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it had pleased Heaven, I should have been glad to die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense about dying, and worse than nonsense,&rdquo; cried Miss Clarendon,
      &ldquo;when you see that it did not please Heaven that you should die&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am content to live,&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Content! to be sure you are,&rdquo; said Miss Clarendon. &ldquo;Is this your
      thankfulness to Providence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am resigned&mdash;I am thankful&mdash;I will try to be more so&mdash;but
      cannot be glad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      General Clarendon&rsquo;s bulletins continued with little variation for some
      time; they were always to his sister&mdash;he never mentioned Beauclerc,
      but confined himself to the few lines or words necessary to give his
      promised regular accounts of Mr. Churchill&rsquo;s state, the sum of which
      continued to be for a length of time: &ldquo;Much the same.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Not in
      immediate danger.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Cannot be pronounced out of danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not very consolatory, Helen felt. &ldquo;But while there is life, there is
      hope,&rdquo; as aunt Pennant observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and fear,&rdquo; said Helen; and her hopes and fears on this subject
      alternated with fatiguing reiteration, and with a total incapacity of
      forming any judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauclerc&rsquo;s letter of explanation arrived, and other letters came from him
      from time to time, which, as they were only repetitions of hopes and fears
      as to Churchill&rsquo;s recovery, and of uncertainty as to what might be his own
      future fate, only increased Helen&rsquo;s misery; and as even their expressions
      of devoted attachment could not alter her own determination, while she
      felt how cruel her continued silence must appear, they only agitated
      without relieving her mind. Mrs. Pennant sympathised with and soothed her,
      and knew how to sooth, and how to raise, and to sustain a mind in sorrow,
      suffering under disappointed affection, and sunk almost to despondency;
      for aunt Pennant, besides her softness of manner, and her quick
      intelligent sympathy, had power of consolation of a higher sort, beyond
      any which this world can give. She was very religious, of a cheerfully
      religious turn of mind&mdash;of that truly Christian spirit which hopeth
      all things. When she was a child somebody asked her if she was bred up in
      the fear of the Lord. She said no, but in the love of God. And so she was,
      in that love which casteth out fear. And now the mildness of her piety,
      and the whole tone and manner of her speaking and thinking, reminded Helen
      of that good dear uncle by whom she had been educated. She listened with
      affectionate reverence, and she truly and simply said, &ldquo;You do me good&mdash;I
      think you have done me a great deal of good&mdash;and you shall see it.&rdquo;
       And she did see it afterwards, and Miss Clarendon thought it was her
      doing, and so her aunt let it pass, and was only glad the good was done.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first day Helen went down to the drawing-room, she found there a man
      who looked, as she thought at first glance, like a tradesman&mdash;some
      person, she supposed, come on business, standing waiting for Miss
      Clarendon, or Mrs. Pennant. She scarcely looked at him, but passed on to
      the sofa, beside which was a little table set for her, and on it a
      beautiful work-box, which she began to examine and admire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not nigh so handsome as I could have wished it, then, for you, Miss Helen&mdash;I
      ask pardon, Miss Stanley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen looked up, surprised at hearing herself addressed by one whom she
      had thought a stranger; but yet she knew the voice, and a reminiscence
      came across her mind of having seen him somewhere before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old David Price, ma&rsquo;am. Maybe you forget him, you being a child at that
      time. But since you grew up, you have been the saving of me and many more&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       Stepping quite close to her, he whispered that he had been paid under her
      goodness&rsquo;s order by Mr. James, along with <i>the other creditors</i> that
      had been <i>left</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen by this time recollected who the poor Welshman was&mdash;an
      upholsterer and cabinet-maker, who had been years before employed at the
      Deanery. Never having been paid at the time, a very considerable debt had
      accumulated, and having neither note nor bond, Price said that he had
      despaired of ever obtaining the amount of his earnings. He had, however,
      since the dean&rsquo;s death, been paid in full, and had been able to retire to
      his native village, which happened to be near Llansillen, and most
      grateful he was; and as soon as he perceived that he was recognised, his
      gratitude became better able to express itself. Not well, however, could
      it make its way out for some time; between crying and laughing, and
      between two languages, he was at first scarcely intelligible. Whenever
      much moved, David Price had recourse to his native Welsh, in which he was
      eloquent; and Mrs. Pennant, on whom, knowing that she understood him, his
      eyes turned, was good enough to interpret for him. And when once fairly
      set a-going, there was danger that poor David&rsquo;s garrulous gratitude should
      flow for ever. But it was all honest; not a word of flattery; and his old
      face was in a glow and radiant with feeling, and the joy of telling Miss
      Helen all, how, and about it; particularly concerning the last day when
      Mr. James paid him, and them, and all of them: that was a day Miss Stanley
      ought to have seen; pity she could not have witnessed it; it would have
      done her good to the latest hour of her life. Pity she should never see
      the faces of many, some poorer they might have been than himself; many
      richer, that would have been ruined for ever but for her. For his own
      part, he reckoned himself one of the happiest of them all, in being
      allowed to see her face to face. And he hoped, as soon as she was able to
      get out so far&mdash;but it was not so far&mdash;she would come to see how
      comfortable he was in his own house. It ended at last in his giving a
      shove to the work-box on the table, which, though nothing worth otherwise,
      he knew she could not mislike, on account it was made out of all the
      samples of wood the dean, her uncle, had given to him in former times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the immoderate length of his speeches, and the
      impossibility he seemed to find of ending his visit, Helen was not much
      tired. And when she was able to walk so far, Mrs. Pennant took her to see
      David Price, and in a most comfortable house she found him; and every one
      in that house, down to the youngest child, gathered round her by degrees,
      some more, some less shy, but all with gratitude beaming and smiling in
      their faces. It was delightful to Helen; for there is no human heart so
      engrossed by sorrow, so over whelmed by disappointment, so closed against
      hope of happiness, that will not open to the touch of gratitude.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      But there was still in Helen&rsquo;s inmost soul one deceitful hope. She thought
      she had pulled it up by the roots many times, and the last time
      completely; but still a little fibre lurked, and still it grew again. It
      was the hope that Cecilia would keep that last promise, though at the
      moment Helen had flung from her the possibility; yet now she took it up
      again, and she thought it was possible that Cecilia might be true to her
      word. If her child should be born alive, and if it should be a boy! It
      became a heart-beating suspense as the time approached, and every day the
      news might be expected. The post came in but three times a week at
      Llansillen, and every post day Miss Clarendon repeated her prophecy to her
      aunt, &ldquo;You will see, ma&rsquo;am, the child will be born in good time, and
      alive. You who have always been so much afraid for Lady Cecilia, will find
      she has not feeling enough to do her any harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In due time came a note from the general. &ldquo;A boy! child and mother doing
      well. Give me joy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The joy to Miss Clarendon was much increased by the triumph, in her own
      perfectly right opinion. Mrs. Pennant&rsquo;s was pure affectionate joy for the
      father, and for Lady Cecilia, for whom, all sinner as she was in her
      niece&rsquo;s eyes, this good soul had compassion. Helen&rsquo;s anxiety to hear again
      and again every post was very natural, the aunt thought; quite
      superfluous, the niece deemed it: Lady Cecilia would do very well, no
      doubt, she prophesied again, and laughed at the tremor, the eagerness,
      with which Helen every day asked if there was any letter from Cecilia. At
      last one came, the first in her own hand-writing, and it was to Helen
      herself, and it extinguished all hope. Helen could only articulate, &ldquo;Oh!
      Cecilia!&rdquo; Her emotion, her disappointment, were visible, but
      unaccountable: she could give no reason for it to Miss Clarendon, whose
      wondering eye was upon her; nor even to sympathising aunt Pennant could
      she breathe a word without betraying Cecilia; she was silent, and there
      was all that day, and many succeeding days, a hopelessness of languor in
      her whole appearance. There was, as Miss Clarendon termed it, a
      &ldquo;backsliding in her recovery,&rdquo; which grieved aunt Pennant, and Helen had
      to bear imputation of caprice, and of indolence from Miss Clarendon; but
      even that eye immediately upon her, that eye more severe than ever, had
      not power to rouse her. Her soul was sunk within, nothing farther to hope;
      there, was a dead calm, and the stillness and loneliness of Llansillen
      made that calm almost awful. The life of great excitation which she had
      led previous to her illness, rendered her more sensible of the change, of
      the total want of stimulus. The walks to Price&rsquo;s cottage had been
      repeated, but, though it was a very bright spot, the eye could not always
      be fixed upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bodily exertion being more easy to her now than mental, she took long
      walks, and came in boasting how far she had been, and looking quite
      exhausted. And Miss Clarendon wondered at her wandering out alone; then
      she tried to walk with Miss Clarendon, and she was more tired, though the
      walks were shorter&mdash;and that was observed, and was not agreeable
      either to the observer, or to the observed. Helen endeavoured to make up
      for it; she followed Miss Clarendon about in all her various occupations,
      from flower-garden to conservatory, and from conservatory to pheasantry,
      and to all her pretty cottages, and her schools, and she saw and admired
      all the good that Esther did so judiciously, and with such extraordinary,
      such wonderful energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing wonderful in it,&rdquo; Miss Clarendon said: and as she ungraciously
      rejected praise, however sincere, and required not sympathy, Helen was
      reduced to be a mere silent, stupid, useless stander-by, and she could not
      but feel this a little awkward. She tried to interest herself for the poor
      people in the neighbourhood, but their language was unintelligible to her,
      and her&rsquo;s to them, and it is hard work trying to make objects for oneself
      in quite a new place, and with a pre-occupying sorrow in the mind all the
      time. It was not only hard work to Helen, but it seemed labour in vain&mdash;bringing
      soil by handfulls to a barren rock, where, after all, no plant will take
      root. Miss Clarendon thought that labour could never be in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, when it must be acknowledged that Helen had been sitting too
      long in the same position, with her head leaning on her hand, Miss
      Clarendon in her abrupt voice asked, &ldquo;How much longer, Helen, do you
      intend to sit there, doing only what is the worst thing in the world for
      you&mdash;thinking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen started, and said she feared she had been sitting too long idle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you wish to know how long, I can tell you,&rdquo; said Miss Clarendon; &ldquo;just
      one hour and thirteen minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the stop watch,&rdquo; said Helen, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By my watch,&rdquo; said grave Miss Clarendon; &ldquo;and in the mean time look at
      the quantity of work I have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And done so nicely!&rdquo; said Helen, looking at it with admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do not think to bribe me with admiration; I would rather see you do
      something yourself than hear you praise my doings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had anybody to work for. I have so few friends now in the world who
      would care for anything I could do! But I will try&mdash;you shall see, my
      dear Esther, by and bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By and bye! no, no&mdash;now. I cannot bear to see you any longer, in
      this half-alive, half-dead state.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;that all you say is for my good. I am sure your
      only object is my happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your happiness is not in my power or in your&rsquo;s, but it is in your power
      to deserve to be happy, by doing what is right&mdash;by exerting yourself:&mdash;that
      is my object, for I see you are in danger of being lost in indolence. Now
      you have the truth and the whole truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Many a truth would have come mended from Miss Clarendon&rsquo;s tongue, if it
      had been uttered in a softer tone, and if she had paid a little more
      attention to times and seasons: but she held it the sacred duty of
      sincerity to tell a friend her faults as soon as seen, and without
      circumlocution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Helen set about a drawing. She made it an object to herself,
      to try to copy a view of the dear Deanery in the same style as several
      beautiful drawings of Miss Clarendon&rsquo;s. While she looked over her
      portfolio, several of her old sketches recalled remembrances which made
      her sigh frequently; Miss Clarendon heard her, and said&mdash;&ldquo;I wish you
      would cure yourself of that habit of sighing; it is very bad for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Despondency is not penitence,&rdquo; continued Esther: &ldquo;reverie is not
      reparation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She felt as desirous as ever to make Helen happy at Llansillen, but she
      was provoked to find it impossible to do so. Of a strong body herself,
      capable of great resistance, powerful reaction under disappointment or
      grief, she could ill make allowance for feebler health and spirits&mdash;perhaps
      feebler character. For great misfortunes she had great sympathy, but she
      could not enter into the details of lesser sorrows, especially any of the
      sentimental kind, which she was apt to class altogether under the head&mdash;&ldquo;Sorrows
      of my Lord Plumcake!&rdquo; an expression which had sovereignly taken her fancy,
      and which her aunt did not relish, or quite understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pennant was, indeed, as complete a contrast to her niece in these
      points, as nature and habit joined could produce. She was naturally of the
      most exquisitely sympathetic mimosa-sensibility, shrinking and expanding
      to the touch of others&rsquo; joy or woe; and instead of having by long use worn
      this out, she had preserved it wonderfully fresh in advanced years. But,
      notwithstanding the contrast and seemingly incompatible difference between
      this aunt and niece, the foundations of their characters both being good,
      sound, and true, they lived on together well, and loved each other dearly.
      They had seldom differed so much on any point as in the present case, as
      to their treatment of their patient and their guest. Scarcely a day passed
      in which they did not come to some mutual remonstrance; and sometimes when
      she was by, which was not pleasant to her, as may be imagined. Yet perhaps
      even these little altercations and annoyances, though they tried Helen&rsquo;s
      temper or grieved her heart at the moment, were of use to her upon the
      whole, by drawing her out of herself. Besides, these daily vicissitudes&mdash;made
      by human temper, manner, and character&mdash;supplied in some sort the
      total want of events, and broke the monotony of these tedious months.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general&rsquo;s bulletins, however, became at last more favourable: Mr.
      Churchill was decidedly better; his physician hoped he might soon be
      pronounced out of danger. The general said nothing of Beauclerc, but that
      he was, he believed, still at Paris. And from this time forward no more
      letters came from Beauclerc to Helen; as his hopes of Churchill&rsquo;s recovery
      increased, he expected every day to be released from his banishment, and
      was resolved to write no more till he could say that he was free. But
      Helen, though she did not allow it to herself, felt this deeply: she
      thought that her determined silence had at last convinced him that all
      pursuit of her was vain; and that he submitted to her rejection: she told
      herself it was what should be, and yet she felt it bitterly. Lady
      Cecilia&rsquo;s letters did not mention him, indeed they scarcely told anything;
      they had become short and constrained: the general, she said, advised her
      to go out more, and her letters often concluded in haste, with &ldquo;Carriage
      at the door,&rdquo; and all the usual excuses of a London life.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day when Helen was sitting intently drawing, Miss Clarendon said
      &ldquo;Helen!&rdquo; so suddenly that she started and looked round; Miss Clarendon was
      seated on a low stool at her aunt&rsquo;s feet, with one arm thrown over her
      great dog&rsquo;s neck; he had laid his head on her lap, and resting on him, she
      looked up with a steadiness, a fixity of repose, which brought to Helen&rsquo;s
      mind Raphael&rsquo;s beautiful figure of Fortitude leaning on her lion; she
      thought she had never before seen Miss Clarendon look so handsome, so
      graceful, so interesting; she took care not to say so, however.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen!&rdquo; continued Miss Clarendon, &ldquo;do you remember the time when I was at
      Clarendon Park and quitted it so abruptly? My reasons were good, whatever
      my manner was; the opinion of the world I am not apt to fear for myself,
      or even for my brother, but to the whispers of conscience I do listen.
      Helen! I was conscious that certain feelings in my mind were too strong,&mdash;in
      me, you would scarcely believe it&mdash;too tender. I had no reason to
      think that Granville Beauclerc liked me; it was therefore utterly unfit
      that I should think of him: I felt this, I left Clarendon Park, and from
      that moment I have refused myself the pleasure of his society, I have
      altogether ceased to think of him. This is the only way to conquer a
      hopeless attachment. But you, Helen, though you have commanded him never
      to attempt to see you again, have not been able to command your own mind.
      Since Mr. Churchill is so much better, you expect that he will soon be
      pronounced out of danger&mdash;you expect that Mr. Beauclerc will come
      over&mdash;come here, and be at your feet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect nothing,&rdquo; said Helen in a faltering voice, and then added
      resolutely, &ldquo;I cannot foresee what Mr. Beauclerc may do, but of this be
      assured, Miss Clarendon, that until I stand as I once stood, and as I
      deserve to stand, in the opinion of your brother; unless, above all, I can
      bring <i>proofs</i> to Granville&rsquo;s confiding heart, that I have ever been
      unimpeachable of conduct and of mind, and in all but one circumstance true&mdash;true
      as yourself, Esther&mdash;never, never, though your brother and all the
      world consented, never till I myself felt that I was <i>proved</i> to be
      as worthy to be his wife as I think I am, would I consent to marry him&mdash;no,
      not though my heart were to break.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Pennant; &ldquo;and I wish&mdash;oh, how I wish&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Lady Cecilia were hanged, as she deserves,&rdquo; said Miss Clarendon: &ldquo;so
      do I, I am sure; but that is nothing to the present purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen!&rdquo; continued Esther, &ldquo;remember that Lady Blanche Forrester is at
      Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen shrank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Cecilia tells you there is no danger; I say there is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you say so, my dear Esther?&rdquo; said her aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has not this friend of yours always deceived, misled you, Helen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She can have no motive for deceiving me in this,&rdquo; said Helen: &ldquo;I believe
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe her then!&rdquo; cried Miss Clarendon; &ldquo;believe her, and do not believe
      me, and take the consequences: I have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen sighed, but though she might feel the want of the charm of Lady
      Cecilia&rsquo;s suavity of manner, of her agreeable, and her agreeing temper,
      yet she felt the safe solidity of principle in her present friend, and
      admired, esteemed, and loved, without fear of change, her unblenching
      truth. Pretty ornaments of gold cannot be worked out of the native ore; to
      fashion the rude mass some alloy must be used, and when the slight
      filigree of captivating manner comes to be tested against the sterling
      worth of unalloyed sincerity, weighed in the just balance of adversity, we
      are glad to seize the solid gold, and leave the ornaments to those that
      they deceive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fear about Lady Blanche Forrester was, however, soon set at rest, and
      this time Lady Cecilia was right. A letter from her to Helen announced
      that Lady Blanche was married!&mdash;actually married, and not to
      Granville Beauclerc, but to some other English gentleman at Paris, no
      matter whom. Lord Beltravers and Madame de St. Cymon, disappointed, had
      returned to London; Lady Cecilia had seen Lord Beltravers, and heard the
      news from him. There could be no doubt of the truth of the intelligence,
      and scarcely did Helen herself rejoice in it with more sincerity than did
      Miss Clarendon, and Helen loved her for her candour as well as for her
      sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time passed on; week after week rolled away. At last General Clarendon
      announced to his sister, but without one word to Helen, that Mr. Churchill
      was pronounced out of danger. The news had been sent to his ward, the
      general said, and he expected Granville would return from his banishment
      immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite taken up in the first tumult of her feelings at this intelligence,
      Helen scarcely observed that she had no letter from Cecilia. But even aunt
      Pennant was obliged to confess, in reply to her niece&rsquo;s observation, that
      this was &ldquo;certainly very odd! but we shall soon hear some explanation, I
      hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Clarendon shook her head; she said that she had always thought how
      matters would end; she judged from her brother&rsquo;s letters that he began to
      find out that he was not the happiest of men. Yet nothing to that effect
      was ever said by him; one phrase only excepted, in his letter to her on
      her last birth-day, which began with, &ldquo;In our happy days, my dear Esther.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Clarendon said nothing to Helen upon this subject; she refrained
      altogether from mentioning Lady Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two, three post-days passed without bringing any letter to Helen. The
      fourth, very early in the morning, long before the usual time for the
      arrival of the post, Rose came into her room with a letter in her hand,
      saying, &ldquo;From General Clarendon, ma&rsquo;am. His own man, Mr. Cockburn, has
      just this minute arrived, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;from London.&rdquo; With a trembling hand,
      Helen tore the letter open: not one word from General Clarendon! It was
      only a cover, containing two notes; one from Lord Davenant to the general,
      the other from Lady Davenant to Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Davenant said that Lady Davenant&rsquo;s health had declined so alarmingly
      after their arrival at Petersburgh, that he had insisted upon her return
      to England, and that as soon as the object of his mission was completed,
      he should immediately follow her. A vessel, he said, containing letters
      from England, had been lost, so that they were in total ignorance of what
      had occurred at home; and, indeed, it appeared from the direction of Lady
      Davenant&rsquo;s note to Helen, written on her landing in England, that she had
      left Russia without knowing that the marriage had been broken off, or that
      Helen had quitted General Clarendon&rsquo;s. She wrote&mdash;&ldquo;Let me see you and
      Granville once more before I die. Be in London, at my own house, to meet
      me. I shall be there as soon as I can be moved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The initials only of her name were signed. Elliot added a postscript,
      saying that her lady had suffered much from an unusually long passage, and
      that she was not sure what day they could be in town.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing from Lady Cecilia.&mdash;Cockburn said that her ladyship
      had not been at home when he set out; that his master had ordered him to
      travel all night, to get to Llansillen as fast as possible, and to make no
      delay in delivering the letter to Miss Stanley.
    </p>
    <p>
      To set out instantly, to be in town at her house to meet Lady Davenant,
      was, of course, Helen&rsquo;s immediate determination. General Clarendon had
      sent his travelling carriage for her; and under the circumstances, her
      friends could have no wish but to speed her departure. Miss Clarendon
      expressed surprise at there being no letter from Lady Cecilia, and would
      see and question Cockburn herself; but nothing more was to be learned than
      what he had already told, that the packet from Lady Davenant had come by
      express to his master after Lady Cecilia had driven out, as it had been
      her custom of late, almost every day, to Kensington, to see her child.
      Nothing could be more natural, Mrs. Pennant thought, and she only wondered
      at Esther&rsquo;s unconvinced look of suspicion. &ldquo;Nothing, surely, can be more
      natural, my dear Esther.&rdquo; To which Esther replied, &ldquo;Very likely, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
       Helen was too much hurried and too much engrossed by the one idea of Lady
      Davenant to think of what they said. At parting she had scarcely time even
      to thank her two friends for all their kindness, but they understood her
      feelings, and, as Miss Clarendon said, words on that point were
      unnecessary. Aunt Pennant embraced her again and again, and then let her
      go, saying, &ldquo;I must not detain you, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I must,&rdquo; said Miss Clarendon, &ldquo;for one moment. There is one point on
      which my parting words are necessary. Helen! keep clear of Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s
      affairs, whatever they may be. Hear none of her secrets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen wished she had never heard any; did not believe there were any more
      to hear; but she promised herself and Miss Clarendon that she would
      observe this excellent counsel.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now she was in the carriage, and on her road to town. And now she had
      leisure to breathe, and to think, and to feel. Her thoughts and feelings,
      however, could be only repetitions of fears and hopes about Lady Davenant,
      and uncertainty and dread of what would happen when she should require
      explanation of all that had occurred in her absence. And how would Lady
      Cecilia he able to meet her mother&rsquo;s penetration?&mdash;ill or well, Lady
      Davenant was so clear-sighted. &ldquo;And how shall I,&rdquo; thought Helen, &ldquo;without
      plunging deeper in deceit, avoid revealing the truth? Shall I assist
      Cecilia to deceive her mother in her last moments; or shall I break my
      promise, betray Cecilia&rsquo;s secret, and at last be the death of her mother
      by the shock?&rdquo; It is astonishing how often the mind can go over the same
      thoughts and feelings without coming to any conclusion, any ease from
      racking suspense. In the mean time, on rolled the carriage, and Cockburn,
      according to his master&rsquo;s directions, got her over the ground with all
      conceivable speed.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      When they were within the last stage of London, the carriage suddenly
      stopped, and Helen, who was sitting far back, deep in her endless reverie,
      started forward&mdash;Cockburn was at the carriage-door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lady, coming to meet you, Miss Stanley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Cecilia herself. But Cecilia so changed in her whole appearance,
      that Helen would scarcely have known her. She was so much struck that she
      hardly knew what was said; but the carriage-doors were opened, and Lady
      Cecilia was beside her, and Cockburn shut the door without permitting one
      moment&rsquo;s delay, and on they drove.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia was excessively agitated. Helen had not power to utter a
      word, and was glad that Cecilia went on speaking very fast; though she
      spoke without appearing to know well what she was saying: of Helen&rsquo;s
      goodness in coming so quickly, of her fears that she would never have been
      in time&mdash;&ldquo;but she was in time,&mdash;her mother had not yet arrived.
      Clarendon had gone to meet her on the road, she believed&mdash;she was not
      quite certain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That seemed very extraordinary to Helen. &ldquo;Not quite certain?&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am not,&rdquo; replied Cecilia, and she coloured; her very pale cheek
      flushed; but she explained not at all, she left that subject, and spoke of
      the friends Helen had left at Llansillen&mdash;then suddenly of her
      mother&rsquo;s return&mdash;her hopes&mdash;her fears&mdash;and then, without
      going on to the natural idea of seeing her mother, and of how soon they
      should see her, began to talk of Beauclerc&mdash;of Mr. Churchill&rsquo;s being
      quite out of danger&mdash;of the general&rsquo;s expectation of Beauclerc&rsquo;s
      immediate return. &ldquo;And then, my dearest Helen,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;all will be&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I do not know how it will be!&rdquo; cried she, her tone changing suddenly;
      and, from the breathless hurry in which she had been running on, sinking
      at once to a low broken tone, and speaking very slowly. &ldquo;I cannot tell
      what will become of any of us. We can never be happy again&mdash;any one
      of us. And it is all my doing&mdash;and I cannot die. Oh! Helen, when I
      tell you&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped, and Miss Clarendon&rsquo;s warning counsel, all her own past
      experience, were full in Helen&rsquo;s mind; and after a moment&rsquo;s silence, she
      stopped Cecilia just as she seemed to have gathered power to speak, and
      begged that she would not tell her any thing that was to be kept secret.
      She could not, would not hear any secrets; she turned her head aside, and
      let down the glass, and looked out, as if determined not to be compelled
      to receive this confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you, then, lost all interest, all affection for me, Helen? I deserve
      it!&mdash;But you need not fear me now, Helen: I have done with deception,
      would to Heaven I had never begun with it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the tone and look of truth&mdash;she steadily fixed her eyes upon
      Helen&mdash;and instead of the bright beams that used to play in those
      eyes, there was now a dark deep-seated sorrow, almost despair. Helen was
      touched to the heart: it was indeed impossible for her, it would have been
      impossible for any one who had any feeling, to have looked upon Lady
      Cecilia Clarendon at that moment, and to have recollected what she had so
      lately been, without pity. The friend of her childhood looked upon her
      with all the poignant anguish of compassion&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my dear Cecilia! how changed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen was not sensible that she uttered the words &ldquo;how changed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Changed! yes! I believe I am,&rdquo; said Lady Cecilia, in a calm voice, &ldquo;very
      much changed in appearance, but much more in reality; my mind is more
      altered than my person. Oh! Helen! if you could see into my mind at this
      moment, and know how completely it is changed;&mdash;but it is all in vain
      now! You have suffered, and suffered for me! but your sufferings could not
      equal mine. You lost love and happiness, but still conscious of deserving
      both: I had both at my command, and I could enjoy neither under the
      consciousness, the torture of remorse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen threw her arms round her, and exclaimed, &ldquo;Do not think of me!&mdash;all
      will be well&mdash;since you have resolved on the truth, all will yet be
      well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia sighed deeply and went on.&mdash;&ldquo;I am sure, Helen, you were
      surprised that my child was born alive; at least I was. I believe its
      mother had not feeling enough to endanger its existence. Well, Clarendon
      has that comfort at all events, and, as a boy, it will never put him in
      mind of his mother. Well, Helen, I had hopes of myself to the last minute;
      I really and truly hoped, as I told you, that I should have had courage to
      tell him all when I put the child into his arms. But his joy!&mdash;I
      could not dash his joy&mdash;I could not!&mdash;and then I thought I never
      could. I knew you would give me up; I gave up all hope of myself. I was
      very unhappy, and Clarendon thought I was very ill; and I acknowledge that
      I was anxious about you, and let all the blame fall on you, innocent,
      generous creature!&mdash;I heard my husband perpetually upbraiding you
      when he saw me ill&mdash;all, he said, the consequences of your falsehood&mdash;and
      all the time I knew it was my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Helen, it is impossible to tell you all the daily, hourly
      necessities for dissimulation which occurred. Every day, you know, we were
      to send to inquire for Mr. Churchill; and every day when Clarendon brought
      me the bulletin, he pitied me, and blamed you; and the double dealing in
      my countenance he never suspected&mdash;always interpreted favourably. Oh,
      such confidence as he had in me&mdash;and how it has been wasted, abused!
      Then letters from Beauclerc&mdash;how I bore to hear them read I cannot
      conceive: and at each time that I escaped, I rejoiced and reproached
      myself&mdash;and reproached myself and rejoiced. I succeeded in every
      effort at deception, and was cursed by my own success. Encouraged to
      proceed, I soon went on without shame and without fear. The general heard
      me defending you against the various reports which my venomous cousin had
      circulated, and he only admired what he called &lsquo;my amiable zeal.&rsquo; His love
      for me increased, but it gave me no pleasure: for, Helen, now I am going
      to tell you an extraordinary turn which my mind took, for which I cannot
      account&mdash;I can hardly believe it&mdash;it seems out of human nature&mdash;my
      love for him decreased!&mdash;not only because I felt that he would hate
      me if he discovered my deceit, but because he was lowered in my
      estimation! I had always had, as every body has, even my mother, the
      highest opinion of his judgment. To that judgment I had always looked up;
      it had raised me in my own opinion; it was a motive to me to be equal to
      what he thought me: but now that motive was gone, I no longer looked up to
      him; his credulous affection had blinded his judgment&mdash;he was my
      dupe! I could not reverence&mdash;I could not love one who was my dupe.
      But I cannot tell you how shocked I was at myself when I felt my love for
      him decrease every time I saw him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought myself a monster; I had grown use to every thing but that&mdash;that
      I could not endure; it was a darkness of the mind&mdash;a coldness; it was
      as if the sun had gone out of the universe; it was more&mdash;it was worse&mdash;it
      was as if I was alone in the world. Home was a desert to me. I went out
      every evening; sometimes, but rarely, Clarendon accompanied me: he had
      become more retired; his spirits had declined with mine; and though he was
      glad I should go out and amuse myself, yet he was always exact as to the
      hours of my return. I was often late&mdash;later than I ought to have
      been, and I made a multitude of paltry excuses; this it was, I believe,
      which first shook his faith in my truth; but I was soon detected in a more
      decided failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I never had the least taste for play of any kind: you may
      remember I used to be scolded for never minding what I was about at
      ecarté: in short, I never had the least love for it&mdash;it wearied me;
      but now that my spirits were gone, it was a sort of intoxication in which
      I cannot say I indulged&mdash;for it was no indulgence, but to which I had
      recourse. Louisa Castlefort, you know, was always fond of play&mdash;got
      into her first difficulties by that means&mdash;she led me on. I lost a
      good deal of money to her, and did not care about it as long as I could
      pay; but presently it came to a time when I could not pay without applying
      to the general: I applied to him, but under false pretences&mdash;to pay
      this bill or that, or to buy something, which I never bought: this
      occurred so often and to such extent, that he suspected&mdash;he
      discovered how it went; he told me so. He spoke in that low, suppressed,
      that terrible voice which I had heard once before; I said, I know not
      what, in deprecation of his anger. &lsquo;I am not angry, Cecilia,&rsquo; said he. I
      caught his hand, and would have detained him; he withdrew that hand, and,
      looking at me, exclaimed, &lsquo;Beautiful creature! half those charms would I
      give for <i>truth!</i>&rsquo; He left the room, and there was contempt in his
      look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All my love&mdash;all my reverence, returned for him in an instant; but
      what could I say? He never recurred to the subject; and now, when I saw
      the struggle in his mind, my passion for him returned in all its force.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People who flattered me often, you know, said I was fascinating, and I
      determined to use my powers of fascination to regain my husband&rsquo;s heart;
      how little I knew that heart! I dressed to please him&mdash;oh! I never
      dressed myself with such care in my most coquettish days;&mdash;I gave a
      splendid ball; I dressed to please him&mdash;he used to be delighted with
      my dancing: he had said, no matter what, but I wanted to make him say it&mdash;feel
      it again; he neither said nor felt it. I saw him standing looking at me,
      and at the close of the dance I heard from him one sigh. I was more in
      love with him than when first we were married, and he saw it, but that did
      not restore me to his confidence&mdash;his esteem; nothing could have done
      that, but&mdash;what I had not. One step in dissimulation led to another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After Lord Beltravers returned from Paris on Lady Blanche&rsquo;s marriage, I
      used to meet him continually at Louisa Castlefort&rsquo;s. As for play, that was
      over with me for ever, but I went to Louisa&rsquo;s continually, because it was
      the gayest house I could go to; I used to meet Lord Beltravers there, and
      he pretended to pay me a vast deal of attention, to which I was utterly
      indifferent, but his object was to push his sister into society again by
      my means. He took advantage of that unfortunate note which I had received
      from Madame de St. Cymon, when she was at Old Forest; he wanted me to
      admit her among my acquaintance; he urged it in every possible way, and
      was excessively vexed that it would not do: not that he cared for her; he
      often spoke of her in a way that shocked me, but it hurt his pride that
      she should be excluded from the society to which her rank entitled her. I
      had met her at Louisa&rsquo;s once or twice; but when I found that for her
      brother&rsquo;s sake she was always to be invited, I resolved to go there no
      more, and I made a merit of this with Clarendon. He was pleased; he said,
      &lsquo;That is well, that is right, my dear Cecilia.&rsquo; And he went out more with
      me. One night at the Opera, the Comtesse de St. Cymon was in the box
      opposite to us, no lady with her, only some gentlemen. She watched me; I
      did all I could to avoid her eye, but at an unlucky moment she caught
      mine, bent forward, and had the assurance to bow. The general snatched the
      opera-glass from my hand, made sure who it was, and then said to me,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;How does that woman dare to claim your notice, Lady Cecilia? I am afraid
      there must have been some encouragement on your part.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;None,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;nor ever shall be; you see I take no notice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But you must have taken notice, or this could never be?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No indeed!&rsquo; persisted I. &lsquo;Helen! I really forgot at the moment that
      first unfortunate note. An instant afterwards I recollected it, and the
      visit about the cameos, but that was not my fault. I had, to be sure,
      dropped a card in return at her door, and I ought to have mentioned that,
      but I really did not recollect it till the words had passed my lips, and
      then it was too late, and I did not like to go back and spoil my case by
      an exception. The general did not look quite satisfied; he did not receive
      my assertions as implicitly as formerly. He left the box afterwards to
      speak to some one, and while he was gone in came Lord Beltravers. After
      some preliminary nothings, he went directly to the point; and said in an
      assured manner, &lsquo;I believe you do not know my sister at this distance. She
      has been endeavouring to catch your eye.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The Comtesse de St. Cymon does me too much honour,&rsquo; said I with a slight
      inclination of the head, and elevation of the eyebrow, which spoke
      sufficiently plainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unabashed, and with a most provoking, almost sneering look, he replied,
      &lsquo;Madame de St. Cymon had wished to say a few words to your ladyship on
      your own account; am I to understand this cannot be?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;On my own account?&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I do not in the least understand your
      lordship.&rsquo; &lsquo;I am not sure,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;that I perfectly comprehend it. But
      I know that you sometimes drive to Kensington, and sometimes take a turn
      in the gardens there. My sister lives at Kensington, and could not she,
      without infringing etiquette, meet you in your walk, and have the honour
      of a few words with you? Something she wants to say to you,&rsquo; and here he
      lowered his voice, &lsquo;about a locket, and Colonel D&rsquo;Aubigny.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excessively frightened, and hearing some one at the door, I answered, &lsquo;I
      do not know, I believe I shall drive to Kensington to-morrow.&rsquo; He bowed
      delighted, and relieved me from his presence that instant. The moment
      afterwards General Clarendon came in. He asked me, &lsquo;Was not that Lord
      Beltravers whom I met?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;he came to reproach me for not noticing his sister, and I
      answered him in such a manner as to make him clear that there was no
      hope.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You did right,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;if you did so.&rsquo; My mind was in such confusion
      that I could not quite command my countenance, and I put up my fan as if
      the lights hurt me. &ldquo;&lsquo;Cecilia,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;take care what you are about.
      Remember, it is not my request only, but my command to my wife&rsquo; (he laid
      solemn stress on the words) &lsquo;that she should have no communication with
      this woman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;My dear Clarendon, I have not the least wish.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I do not ask what your wishes may be; I require only your obedience.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never have I heard such austere words from him. I turned to the stage,
      and I was glad to seize the first minute I could to get away. But what was
      to be done? If I did not go to Kensington, there was this locket, and I
      knew not what, standing out against me. I knew that this wretched woman
      had had Colonel D&rsquo;Aubigny in her train abroad, and supposed that he must&mdash;treacherous
      profligate as he was&mdash;have given the locket to her, and now I was so
      afraid of its coming to Clarendon&rsquo;s eyes or ears!&mdash;and yet why should
      I have feared his knowing about it? Colonel D&rsquo;Aubigny stole it, just as he
      stole the picture. I had got it for you, do you recollect?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;and your mother missed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; continued Lady Cecilia. &ldquo;O that I had had the sense to do nothing
      about it! But I was so afraid of its somehow bringing everything to light:
      my cowardice&mdash;my conscience&mdash;my consciousness of that first
      fatal falsehood before my marriage, has haunted me at the most critical
      moments: it has risen against me, and stood like an evil spirit
      threatening me from the right path.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went to Kensington, trusting to my own good fortune, which had so often
      stood me in stead; but Madame de St. Cymon was too cunning for me, and so
      interested, so mean, she actually bargained for giving up the locket. She
      hinted that she knew Colonel D&rsquo;Aubigny had never been your lover, and
      ended by saying she had not the locket with her; and though I made her
      understand that the general would never allow me to receive her at my own
      house, yet she &lsquo;hoped I could manage an introduction for her to some of my
      friends, and that she would bring the locket on Monday, if I would in the
      mean time try, at least with Lady Emily Greville and Mrs. Holdernesse.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt her meanness, and yet I was almost as mean myself, for I agreed to
      do what I could. Monday came, Clarendon saw me as I was going out, and, as
      he handed me into the carriage, he asked me where I was going. To
      Kensington I said, and added&mdash;oh! Helen, I am ashamed to tell you, I
      added,&mdash;I am going to see my child. And there I found Madame de St.
      Cymon, and I had to tell her of my failure with Lady Emily and Mrs.
      Holdernesse. I softened their refusal as much as I could, but I might have
      spared myself the trouble, for she only retorted by something about
      English prudery. At this moment a shower of rain came on, and she insisted
      upon my taking her home; &lsquo;Come in,&rsquo; said she, when the carriage stopped at
      her door: &lsquo;if you will come in, I will give it to you now, and you need
      not have the trouble of calling again.&rsquo; I had the folly to yield, though I
      saw that it was a trick to decoy me into her house, and to make it pass
      for a visit. It all flashed upon me, and yet I could not resist, for I
      thought I must obtain the locket at all hazards. I resolved to get it from
      her before I left the house, and then I thought all would be finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She looked triumphant as she followed me into her saloon, and gave a
      malicious smile, which seemed to say, &lsquo;You see you are visiting me after
      all.&rsquo; After some nonsensical conversation, meant to detain me, I pressed
      for the locket, and she produced it: it was indeed the very one that had
      been made for you&mdash;But just at that instant, while she still held it
      in her band, the door suddenly opened, and Clarendon stood opposite to me!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard Madame de St. Cymon&rsquo;s voice, but of what she said, I have no
      idea. I heard nothing but the single word &lsquo;rain&rsquo; and with scarcely
      strength to articulate, I attempted to follow up that excuse. Clarendon&rsquo;s
      look of contempt!&mdash;But he commanded himself, advanced calmly to me,
      and said, &lsquo;I came to Kensington with these letters; they have just arrived
      by express. Lady Davenant is in England&mdash;she is ill.&rsquo; He gave me the
      packet, and left the room, and I heard the sound of his horses&rsquo; feet the
      next instant as he rode off. I broke from Madame de St. Cymon, forgetting
      the locket and everything. I asked my servants which way the general had
      gone? &lsquo;To Town.&rsquo; I perceived that he must have been going to look for me
      at the nurse&rsquo;s, and had seen the carriage at Madame de St. Cymon&rsquo;s door. I
      hastened after him, and then I recollected that I had left the locket on
      the table at Madame de St. Cymon&rsquo;s, that locket for which I had hazarded&mdash;lost&mdash;everything!
      The moment I reached home, I ran to Clarendon&rsquo;s room; he was not there,
      and oh! Helen, I have not seen him since!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From some orders which he left about horses, I suppose he went to meet my
      mother. I dared not follow him. She had desired me to wait for her arrival
      at her own house. All yesterday, all last night, Helen, what I have
      suffered! I could not bear it any longer, and then I thought of coming to
      meet you. I thought I must see you before my mother arrived&mdash;my
      mother! but Clarendon will not have met her till to-day. Oh, Helen! you
      feel all that I fear&mdash;all that I foresee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia sank back, and Helen, overwhelmed with all she had heard,
      could for some time only pity her in silence; and at last could only
      suggest that the general would not have time for any private communication
      with Lady Davenant, as her woman would be in the carriage with her, and
      the general was on horseback.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late in the day before they reached town. As they came near
      Grosvenor Square, Cockburn inquired whether they were to drive home, or to
      Lady Davenant&rsquo;s?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To my mother&rsquo;s, certainly, and as fast as you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Davenant had not arrived, but there were packages in the hall, her
      courier, and her servants, who said that General Clarendon was with her,
      but not in the carriage; he had sent them on. No message for Lady Cecilia,
      but that Lady Davenant would be in town this night.
    </p>
    <p>
      To night&mdash;some hours still of suspense! As long as there were
      arrangements to be made, anything to do or to think of but that meeting of
      which they dared not think, it was endurable, but too soon all was
      settled; nothing to be done, but to wait and watch, to hear the carriages
      roll past, and listen, and start, and look at each other, and sink back
      disappointed. Lady Cecilia walked from the sofa to the window, and looked
      out, and back again&mdash;-continually, continually, till at last Helen
      begged her to sit down. She sat down before an old piano-forte of her
      mother&rsquo;s, on which her eyes fixed; it was one on which she had often
      played with Helen when they were children. &ldquo;Happy, innocent days,&rdquo; said
      she; &ldquo;I never shall we be so happy again, Helen! But I cannot think of
      it;&rdquo; she rose hastily, and threw herself on the sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      A servant, who had been watching at the hall-door, came in&mdash;&ldquo;The
      carriage, my lady! Lady Davenant is coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia started up; they ran down stairs; the carriage stopped, and
      in the imperfect light they saw the figure of Lady Davenant, scarcely
      altered, leaning upon General Clarendon&rsquo;s arm. The first sound of her
      voice was feebler, softer, than formerly&mdash;quite tender, when she
      said, as she embraced them both by turns, &ldquo;My dear children!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have accomplished your journey, Lady Davenant, better than you
      expected,&rdquo; said the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something struck her in the tone of his voice. She turned quickly, saw her
      daughter lay her hand upon his arm, and saw that arm withdrawn!
    </p>
    <p>
      They all entered the saloon&mdash;it was a blaze of light; Lady Davenant,
      shading her eyes with her hand, looked round at the countenances, which
      she had not yet seen. Lady Cecilia shrank back. The penetrating eyes
      turned from her, glanced at Helen, and fixed upon the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is all this?&rdquo; cried she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen threw her arms round Lady Davenant. &ldquo;Let us think of you first, and
      only&mdash;be calm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Davenant broke from her, and pressing forwards exclaimed, &ldquo;I must see
      my daughter&mdash;if I have still a daughter! Cecilia!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general moved. Lady Cecilia, who had sunk upon a chair behind him,
      attempted to rise. Lady Davenant stood opposite to her; the light was now
      full upon her face and figure; and her mother saw how it was changed! and
      looking back at Helen, she said in a low, awful tone, &ldquo;I see it; the black
      spot has spread!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had Lady Davenant pronounced these words, when she was seized
      with violent spasms. The general had but just time to save her from
      falling; he could not leave her. All was terror! Even her own woman, so
      long used to these attacks, said it was the worst she had ever seen, and
      for some time evidently feared it would terminate fatally. At last slowly
      she came to herself, but perfectly in possession of her intellects, she
      sat up, looked round, saw the agony in her daughter&rsquo;s countenance, and
      holding out her hand to her, said, &ldquo;Cecilia, if there is anything that I
      ought to know, it should be said now.&rdquo; Cecilia caught her mother&rsquo;s hand,
      and threw herself upon her knees. &ldquo;Helen, Helen, stay!&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;do not
      go, Clarendon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood leaning against the chimney-piece, motionless, while Cecilia, in
      a faltering voice, began; her voice gaining strength, she went on, and
      poured out all&mdash;even from the very beginning, that first suppression
      of the truth, that first cowardice, then all that followed from that one
      falsehood&mdash;all&mdash;even to the last degradation, when in the power,
      in the presence of that bad woman, her husband found and left her. She
      shuddered as she came to the thought of that look of his, and not daring,
      not having once dared while she spoke, to turn towards him, her eyes fixed
      upon her mother&rsquo;s; but as she finished speaking, her head sank, she laid
      her face on the sofa beside her; she felt her mother&rsquo;s arm thrown over her
      and she sobbed convulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have still a daughter!&rdquo; were the first words that broke the silence.
      &ldquo;Not such as I might have had, but that is my own fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have still a daughter,&rdquo; repeated Lady Davenant. &ldquo;There is,&rdquo; continued
      she, turning to General Clarendon, &ldquo;there is a redeeming power in truth.
      She may yet be more worthy to be your wife than she has ever yet been!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; exclaimed the general. His countenance was rigid as iron; then
      suddenly it relaxed, and going up to Helen, he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have done you injustice, Miss Stanley. I have been misled. I have done
      you injustice, and by Heaven! I will do you public justice, cost me what
      it will. Beauclerc will be in England in a few days, at the altar I will
      give you to him publicly; in the face of all the world, will I mark my
      approbation of his choice; publicly will I repair the wrong I have done
      you. I will see his happiness and yours before I leave England for ever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia started up: &ldquo;Clarendon!&rdquo; was all she could say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Lady Cecilia Clarendon,&rdquo; said he, all the stern fixedness of his
      face returning at once&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, Lady Cecilia Clarendon, we separate,
      now and for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then turning from her, he addressed Lady Davenant. &ldquo;I shall be ordered on
      some foreign service. Your daughter, Lady Davenant, will remain with you,
      while I am still in England, unless you wish otherwise&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave my daughter with me, my dear general, till my death,&rdquo; said Lady
      Davenant. She spoke calmly, but the general, after a respectful&mdash;an
      affectionate pressure of the hand she held out to him, said, &ldquo;That may be
      far distant, I trust in God, and we shall at all events meet again the day
      of Helen&rsquo;s marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if that day is to be a happy day to me,&rdquo; cried Helen, &ldquo;to me or to
      your own beloved ward, General Clarendon, it must be happy to Cecilia!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As happy as she has left it in my power to make her. When I am gone, my
      fortune&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name it not as happiness for my daughter,&rdquo; interrupted Lady Davenant, &ldquo;or
      you do her injustice, General Clarendon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I name it but to do her justice,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It is all that she has left
      it in my power to give;&rdquo; and then his long suppressed passion suddenly
      bursting forth, he turned to Cecilia. &ldquo;All I can give to one so false&mdash;false
      from the first moment to the last&mdash;false to me&mdash;to me! who so
      devotedly, fondly, blindly loved her!&rdquo; He rushed out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Lady Davenant, taking her daughter in her arms, said, &ldquo;My child,
      return to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sank back exhausted. Mrs. Elliott was summoned, she wished them all
      out of the room, and said so; but Lady Davenant would have her daughter
      stay beside her, and with Cecilia&rsquo;s hand in hers, she fell into a profound
      slumber.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On awaking in the morning, after some long-expected event has happened, we
      feel in doubt whether it has really occurred, or whether it is all a
      dream. Then comes the awful sense of waking truth, and the fear that what
      has been done, or said, is irremediable, and then the astonishment that it
      really is done. &ldquo;It is over!&rdquo; Helen repeated to herself, repeated aloud,
      before she could well bring herself from that state of half belief, before
      she could recover her stunned faculties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Characters which she thought she perfectly understood, had each appeared,
      in these new circumstances, different from what she had expected. From
      Cecilia she had scarcely hoped, even at the last moment, for such perfect
      truth in her confession. From Lady Davenant not so much indulgence, not
      all that tenderness for her daughter. From the general, less violence of
      expression, more feeling for Cecilia; he had not allowed the merit of her
      candour, her courage at the last. It was a perfectly voluntary confession,
      all that concerned Colonel D&rsquo;Aubigny, and the letters could never have
      been known to the general by any other means. Disappointed love,
      confidence duped, and his pride of honour, had made him forget himself in
      anger, even to cruelty. Helen thought he would feel this hereafter,
      fancied he must feel it even now, but that, though he might relent, he
      would not recede; though he might regret that he had made the
      determination, he would certainly abide by it; that which he had resolved
      to do, would certainly be done,&mdash;the separation between him and
      Cecilia would take place. And though all was clear and bright in Helen&rsquo;s
      own prospects, the general&rsquo;s esteem restored, his approbation to be
      publicly marked, Beauclerc to be convinced of her perfect innocence!
      Beauclerc, freed from all fear and danger, returning all love and joy; yet
      she could not be happy&mdash;it was all mixed with bitterness, anguish for
      Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had so often so forcibly urged her to this confession! and now it was
      made, did Helen regret that it was made? No, independently of her own
      cleared character, she was satisfied, even for Cecilia&rsquo;s sake, for it was
      right, whatever were the consequences; it was right, and in the confusion
      and discordance of her thoughts and feelings, this was the only fixed
      point. To this conclusion she had come, but had not been able farther to
      settle her mind, when she was told that Lady Davenant was now awake, and
      wished to see her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Davenant, renovated by sleep, appeared to Helen, even when she saw
      her by daylight, scarcely altered in her looks. There was the same life,
      and energy, and elasticity, and strength, Helen hoped, not only of mind,
      but of body, and quick as that hope rose, as she stood beside her bed, and
      looked upon her, Lady Davenant marked it, and said, &ldquo;You are mistaken, my
      dear Helen, I shall not last long; I am now to consider how I am to make
      the most of the little life that remains. How to repair as far as may be,
      as far as can be, in my last days, the errors of my youth! You know,
      Helen, what I mean, and it is now no time to waste words, therefore I
      shall not begin by wasting upon you, Helen, any reproaches. Foolish,
      generous, weak creature that you are, and as the best of human beings will
      ever be&mdash;I must be content with you as you are; and so,&rdquo; continued
      she, in a playful tone, &ldquo;we must love one another, perhaps all the better,
      for not being too perfect. And indeed, my poor child, you have been well
      punished already, and the worst of criminals need not be punished twice.
      Of the propensity to sacrifice your own happiness for others you will
      never be cured, but you will, I trust, in future, when I am gone never to
      return, be true to yourself. Now as to my daughter&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Davenant then went over with Helen every circumstance in Cecilia&rsquo;s
      confession, and showed how, in the midst of the shock she had felt at the
      disclosure of so much falsehood, hope for her daughter&rsquo;s future truth had
      risen in her mind even from the courage, and fulness, and exactness of her
      confession. &ldquo;And it is not,&rdquo; continued she, &ldquo;a sudden reformation; I have
      no belief in sudden reformations. I think I see that this change in
      Cecilia&rsquo;s mind has been some time working out by her own experience of the
      misery, the folly, the degradation of deceit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen earnestly confirmed this from her own observations, and from the
      expressions which had burst forth in the fulness of Cecilia&rsquo;s heart and
      strength of her conviction, when she told her all that had passed in her
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is well!&rdquo; pursued Lady Davenant; &ldquo;but principles cannot be depended
      upon till confirmed by habit; and Cecilia&rsquo;s nature is so variable&mdash;impressions
      on her are easily, even deeply made, but all in sand; they may shift with
      the next tide&mdash;may be blown away by the next wind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; exclaimed Helen, &ldquo;there is no danger of that. I see the
      impression deepening every hour, from your kindness and&mdash;&rdquo; Helen
      hesitated, &ldquo;And besides&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Besides</i>,&rdquo; said Lady Davenant, &ldquo;usually comes as the <i>arrière-ban</i>
      of weak reasons: you mean to say that the sight of my sufferings must
      strengthen, must confirm all her principles&mdash;her taste for truth.
      Yes,&rdquo; continued she, in her most firm tone, &ldquo;Cecilia&rsquo;s being with me
      during my remaining days will be painful but salutary to her. She sees, as
      you do, that all the falsehood meant to save me has been in vain; that at
      last the shock has only hastened my end: it must be so, Helen. Look at it
      steadily, in the best point of view&mdash;the evil you cannot avert; take
      the good and be thankful for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Cecilia&mdash;how did she feel? Wretched she was, but still in her
      wretchedness there was within her a relieved conscience and the sustaining
      power of truth; and she had now the support of her mother&rsquo;s affection, and
      the consolation of feeling that she had at last done Helen justice! To her
      really generous, affectionate disposition, there was in the return of her
      feelings to their natural course, an indescribable sense of relief.
      Broken, crushed, as were all her own hopes, her sympathy, even in the
      depths of her misery, now went pure, free from any windings of deceit,
      direct to Helen&rsquo;s happy prospects, in which she shared with all the
      eagerness of her warm heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauclerc arrived, found the general at home expecting him, and in his
      guardian&rsquo;s countenance and voice he saw and heard only what was natural to
      the man. The general was prepared, and Beauclerc was himself in too great
      impatience to hear the facts, to attend much to the manner in which things
      were told.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Davenant has returned ill; her daughter is with her, and Helen&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Helen&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you may be happy, Beauclerc, if there be truth in woman,&rdquo; said the
      general. &ldquo;Go to her&mdash;you will find I can do justice. Go, and return
      when you can tell me that your wedding-day is fixed. And, Beauclerc,&rdquo; he
      called after him, &ldquo;let it be as soon as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only unnecessary advice my dear guardian has ever given me,&rdquo;
       Beauclerc, laughing, replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general&rsquo;s prepared composure had not calculated upon this laugh, this
      slight jest; his features gave way. Beauclerc, struck with a sudden change
      in the general&rsquo;s countenance, released his hand from the congratulatory
      shake in which its power failed. The general turned away as if to shun
      inquiry, and Beauclerc, however astonished, respected his feelings, and
      said no more. He hastened to Lady Davenant with all a lover&rsquo;s speed&mdash;with
      all a lover&rsquo;s joy saw the first expression in Helen&rsquo;s eyes; and with all a
      friend&rsquo;s sorrow for Lady Davenant and for the general, heard all that was
      to be told of Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s affairs: her mother undertook the
      explanation, Cecilia herself did not appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first rush of Beauclerc&rsquo;s joy in Helen&rsquo;s cleared fame, he was ready
      to forgive all the deceit; yes, to forgive all; but it was such
      forgiveness as contempt can easily grant, which can hardly be received by
      any soul not lost to honour. This Lady Davenant felt, and felt so keenly,
      that Helen trembled for her: she remained silent, pressing her hand upon
      her heart, which told her sense of approaching danger. It was averted by
      the calmness, the truth, the justice with which Helen spoke to Beauclerc
      of Cecilia. As she went on, Lady Davenant&rsquo;s colour returned and
      Beauclerc&rsquo;s ready sympathy went with her as far as she pleased, till she
      came to one point, from which he instantly started back. Helen proposed,
      if Beauclerc would consent, to put off their marriage till the general
      should be reconciled to Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Attempt it not, Helen,&rdquo; cried Lady Davenant; &ldquo;delay not for any
      consideration. Your marriage must be as soon as possible, for my sake, for
      Cecilia&rsquo;s&mdash;mark me!&mdash;for Cecilia&rsquo;s sake, as soon as possible let
      it be; it is but justice that her conscience should be so far relieved,
      let her no longer obstruct your union. Let me have the satisfaction of
      seeing it accomplished; name the day, Helen, I may not have many to live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The day, the earliest possible, was named by Helen; and the moment it was
      settled, Lady Davenant hurried Beauclerc away, saying&mdash;&ldquo;Return to
      General Clarendon&mdash;spare him suspense&mdash;it is all we can do for
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general&rsquo;s wishes in this, and in all that followed, were to be obeyed.
      He desired that the marriage should be public, that all should be bidden
      of rank, fashion, and note&mdash;all their family connections. Lady
      Katrine Hawksby, he especially named. To do justice to Helen seemed the
      only pleasurable object now remaining to him. In speaking to Beauclerc, he
      never once named Lady Cecilia; it seemed a tacit compact between him and
      Beauclerc, that her name should not be pronounced. They talked of Lady
      Davenant; the general said he did not think her in such danger as she
      seemed to consider herself to be: his opinion was, he declared, confirmed
      by his own observation; by the strength of mind and of body which she had
      shown since her arrival in England. Beauclerc could only hope that he was
      right; and the general went on to speak of the service upon which he was
      to be employed: said that all <i>arrangements</i>, laying an emphasis upon
      the word, would be transacted by his man of business. He spoke of what
      would happen after he quitted England, and left his ward a legacy of some
      favourite horse which he used to ride at Clarendon Park, and seemed to
      take it for granted that Beauclerc and Helen would be sometimes there when
      he was gone. Then, having cleared his throat several times, the general
      desired that Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s portrait, which he designated only as &ldquo;the
      picture over the chimney-piece in my room,&rdquo; should be sent after him. And
      taking leave of Beauclerc, he set off for Clarendon Park, where he was to
      remain till the day before the wedding;&mdash;the day following he had
      fixed for his departure from England.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Beauclerc was repeating this conversation to Helen, Lady Davenant
      came into the room just as he was telling these last particulars. She
      marked the smile, the hope that was excited, but shook her head, and said,
      &ldquo;Raise no false hopes in my daughter&rsquo;s mind, I conjure you;&rdquo; and she
      turned the conversation to other subjects. Beauclerc had been to see Mr.
      Churchill, and of that visit Lady Davenant wished to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to health, Beauclerc said that Mr. Churchill had recovered almost
      perfectly; &ldquo;but there remains, and I fear will always remain, a little
      lameness, not disabling, but disfiguring&mdash;an awkwardness in moving,
      which, to a man of his personal pretensions, is trying to the temper; but
      after noticing the impediment as he advanced to meet me, he shook my hand
      cordially, and smiling, said, &lsquo;You see I am a marked man; I always wished
      to be so, you know, so pray do not repent, my good friend.&rsquo; He saw I was
      too much moved for jesting, then he took it more seriously, but still
      kindly, assuring me that I had done him real service; it is always of
      service, he said, to be necessitated to take time for quiet reflection, of
      which he had had sufficient in his hours of solitary confinement&mdash;this
      little adversity had left him leisure to be good.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; continued Beauclerc, &ldquo;Churchill adverting to our foolish
      quarrel, to clear that off my mind, threw the whole weight of the blame at
      once comfortably upon the absent&mdash;on Beltravers. Churchill said we
      had indeed been a couple of bravely blind fools; he ought, as he observed,
      to have recollected in time, that
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">  &lsquo;A full hot horse, who being allowed his way,<br />  Self-mettle tires him.&lsquo;<br /></pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that was good, and Horace, in perfect good-humour with me and himself,
      and all the world, played on with the past and the future, glad he had no
      more of his bones to exfoliate; glad, after so many months of failure in
      &lsquo;the first intention,&rsquo; to find himself in a whole skin, and me safe
      returned from transportation&mdash;spoke of Helen seriously; said that his
      conduct to her was the only thing that weighed upon his mind, but he hoped
      that his sincere penitence, and his months of suffering, would be
      considered as sufficient atonement for his having brought her name before
      the public; and he finished by inviting himself to our wedding, if it were
      only for the pleasure of seeing what sort of a face Lady Katrine Hawksby
      will have upon the occasion.&mdash;It was told of a celebrated statesman,
      jealous of his colleagues, Horace says, that every commonly good speech
      cost him a twinge of the gout; and every uncommonly good one sent him to
      bed with a regular fit. Now Horace protests that every commonly decent
      marriage of her acquaintance costs Lady Katrine at least a sad headache;
      but Miss Stanley&rsquo;s marriage, likely as it is to be so happy after all, as
      he politely said, foredooms poor Lady Katrine to a month&rsquo;s heartache at
      the least, and a face full ell long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whether in his penitence he had forsworn slander or not, it was plain that
      Churchill had not lost either his taste, talent, or power of sarcasm, and
      of this Beauclerc could have given, and in time gave, further
      illustrations; but it was in a case which came home to him rather too
      nearly, and on which his reports did not flow quite so fluently&mdash;touching
      Lord Beltravers, it was too tender a subject. Beauclerc was ashamed of
      himself for having been so deceived when, after all his guardian had done
      to save his fortune, after all that noble sacrifice had been made, he
      found that it was to no good end, but for the worst purpose possible. Lord
      Beltravers, as it was now clear, never had the slightest intention of
      living in that house of his ancestors on which Beauclerc had lavished his
      thousands, ay, and tens of thousands: but while he was repairing, and
      embellishing, and furnishing Old Forest, fit for an English aristocrat of
      the first water, the Lord Beltravers at the gaming-table, pledged it, and
      lost it, and sold it; and it went to the hammer. This came out in the
      first fury of Lord Beltravers upon his sister&rsquo;s marriage at Paris: and
      then and there Beauclerc first came to the perception that his good friend
      had predestined him and his fortune for the Lady Blanche, whom, all the
      time, he considered as a fool and a puppet, and for whom he had not the
      slightest affection: it was all for his own interested purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauclerc suddenly opened his eyes wide, and saw it all at once: how it
      had happened that they had never seen it before, notwithstanding all that
      the general on one side, and Lady Davenant on the other, had done to force
      them open, was incomprehensible; but, as Lady Davenant observed, &ldquo;A sort
      of cataract comes over the best eyes for a time, and the patient will not
      suffer himself to be couched; and if you struggle to perform the operation
      that is to do him good against his will, it is odds but you blind him for
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen could not, however, understand how Granville could have been so
      completely deceived, except that it had been impossible for him to imagine
      the exquisite meanness of that man&rsquo;s mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; cried Beauclerc, &ldquo;you see my fault was having too little, instead
      of too much imagination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Davenant smiled, and said, &ldquo;It has been admirably observed, that it
      is among men as among certain tribes of animals, it is sometimes only
      necessary that one of the herd should step forward and lead the way, to
      make all the others follow with alacrity and submission; and I solve the
      whole difficulty thus: I suppose that Lord Beltravers, just following
      Beauclerc&rsquo;s lead, succeeded in persuading him that he was a man of genius
      and a noble fellow, by allowing all Beauclerc&rsquo;s own paradoxes, adopting
      all his ultra-original opinions, and, in short, sending him back the image
      of his own mind, till Granville had been caught by it, and had fairly
      fallen in love with it&mdash;a mental metaphysical Narcissus.&rdquo; [Footnote:
      Lord Mahon.] &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; continued Lady Davenant, smiling, &ldquo;of all the
      follies of youth, the dangerous folly of trying to do good&mdash;that for
      which you stand convicted, may be the most easily pardoned, the most
      safely left to time and experience to cure. You know, Granville, that ever
      since the time of Alexander the Great&rsquo;s great tutor, the characteristic
      faults of youth and age have been the &lsquo;<i>too much</i>&rsquo; and the &lsquo;<i>too
      little</i>.&rsquo; In youth, the too much confidence in others and in
      themselves, the too much of enthusiasm&mdash;too much of benevolence;&mdash;in
      age, alas! too little. And with this youth, who has the too much in every
      thing&mdash;what shall we do with him, Helen? Take him, for better for
      worse, you must; and I must love him as I have done from his childhood, a
      little while longer&mdash;to the end of my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little longer, to the end of her life!&rdquo; said Beauclerc to himself, as
      leaning on the back of Helen&rsquo;s chair he looked at Lady Davenant. &ldquo;I cannot
      believe that she whom I see before me is passing away, to be with us but a
      little longer; so full of life as she appears; such energy divine! No, no,
      she will live, live long!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as his eyes looked that hope, Helen caught it, and yet she doubted,
      and sighed, but still she had hope. Cecilia had none; she was sitting
      behind her mother; she looked up at Helen, and shook her head; she had
      seen more of her mother&rsquo;s danger, she had been with her in nights of
      fearful struggle. She had been with her just after she had written to Lord
      Davenant what she must have felt to be a farewell letter&mdash;letter,
      too, which contained the whole history of Cecilia&rsquo;s deception and Helen&rsquo;s
      difficulties, subjects so agitating that the writing of them had left her
      mother in such a state of exhaustion that Cecilia could think only with
      terror for her, yet she exerted all her power over herself to hide her
      anguish, not only for her mother&rsquo;s but for Helen&rsquo;s sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      The preparations for the wedding went on, pressed forward by Lady Davenant
      as urgently as the general could desire. The bridesmaids were to be Lady
      Emily Greville&rsquo;s younger sister, Lady Susan, and, at Helen&rsquo;s particular
      request, Miss Clarendon. Full of joy, wonder, and sympathy, in wedding
      haste Miss Clarendon and Mrs. Pennant arrived both delighted that it was
      all happily settled for Helen: which most, it was scarcely possible to
      say; but which most curious as to the means by which it had been settled,
      it was very possible to see. When Miss Clarendon had secured a private
      moment with Helen, she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now tell me&mdash;tell me everything about yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen could only repeat what the general had already written to her sister&mdash;that
      he was now convinced that the reports concerning Miss Stanley were false,
      his esteem restored, his public approbation to be given, Beauclerc
      satisfied, and her rejection honourably retracted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will ask you no more, Helen, by word or look,&rdquo; said Esther; &ldquo;I
      understand it all, my brother and Lady Cecilia are separated for life. And
      now let us go to aunt Pennant: she will not annoy you by her curiosity,
      but how she will be able to manage her sympathy amongst you with these
      crossing demands I know not; Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s wretchedness will almost spoil
      my aunt&rsquo;s joy for you&mdash;it cannot be pure joy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pure joy! how far from it Helen&rsquo;s sigh told; and Miss Clarendon had
      scarcely patience enough with Lady Cecilia to look at her again; had
      scarcely seconded, at least with good grace, a suggestion of Mrs.
      Pennant&rsquo;s that they should prevail on Lady Cecilia to take a turn in the
      park with them, she looked so much in want of fresh air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can go now, my dear Esther, you know, before it is time for that
      picture sale, at which you are to be before two o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo; Lady Davenant
      desired Cecilia to go. &ldquo;Helen will be with me, do, my dear Cecilia, go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went, and before the awkwardness of Miss Clarendon&rsquo;s silence ceased,
      and before Mrs. Pennant had settled which glass or which blind was best up
      or down, Lady Cecilia burst into tears, thanked aunt Pennant for her
      sympathy, and now, above the fear of Miss Clarendon&mdash;above all fear
      but that of doing further wrong by concealment, she at once told the whole
      truth, that they might, as well as the general, do full justice to Helen,
      and that they might never, never blame Clarendon for the separation which
      was to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      That he should have mentioned nothing of her conduct even to his sister,
      was not surprising. &ldquo;I know his generous nature,&rdquo; said Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I never knew yours till this moment, Cecilia,&rdquo; cried Miss Clarendon,
      embracing her; &ldquo;my sister, now,&mdash;separation or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there need be no separation,&rdquo; said kind aunt Pennant. Cecilia sighed,
      and Miss Clarendon repeated, &ldquo;You will find in me a sister at all events.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She now saw Cecilia as she really was&mdash;faults and virtues. Perhaps
      indeed in this moment of revulsion of feeling, in the surprise of
      gratified confidence, she overvalued Lady Cecilia&rsquo;s virtues, and was
      inclined to do her more than justice, in her eagerness to make generous
      reparation for unjust suspicion.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      After setting down Lady Cecilia at her mother&rsquo;s, the aunt and niece
      proceeded to the picture sale which Miss Clarendon was eager to attend, as
      she was in search of a pendant to a famous Berghem she possessed; and
      while she was considering the picture, she had the advantage of hearing a
      story, which seemed, indeed, to be told for the amusement of the whole
      room, by a party of fashionables who were standing near her:&mdash;a
      wonderful story of a locket, which was going about; it was variously told,
      but all agreed in one point&mdash;that a young married lady of high rank
      had never dared to appear in the World since her husband had seen this
      locket in her hands&mdash;it had brought out something&mdash;something
      which had occurred before marriage;&mdash;and here mysterious nods were
      interchanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another version stated that the story had not yet been fully explained to
      the husband, that he had found the locket on the table in a room that he
      had suddenly entered, where he discovered her kneeling to the person in
      question,&mdash;&ldquo;the person in question&rdquo; being sometimes a woman and
      sometimes a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then leaned forward, stretching her scraggy neck, one who had good reason
      to believe that the husband would soon speak out&mdash;the public would
      soon hear of a separation: and everybody must be satisfied that there
      could not be a separation without good grounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Clarendon inquired from a gentleman near them, who the lady was with
      the outstretched scraggy neck&mdash;Lady Katrine Hawksby. Miss Clarendon
      knew her only by reputation. She did not know Miss Clarendon either by
      reputation or by sight; and she went on to say, she would &ldquo;venture any
      wager that the separation would take place within a month. In short, there
      could be no doubt that before marriage,&rdquo;&mdash;and she ended with a look
      which gave a death-blow to the reputation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exceedingly shocked, Miss Clarendon, not only from a sense of justice to
      Lady Cecilia, but from feeling for her brother&rsquo;s honour, longed to reply
      in defence; but she constrained herself for once, and having been assured
      by Lady Cecilia that all had been confessed to her mother, she thought
      that Lady Davenant must be the best person to decide what should be done.
      She went to her house immediately, sent in word that she begged to see
      Lady Davenant for two or three minutes alone, was admitted; Cecilia
      immediately vacated the chair beside her mother&rsquo;s bed, and left the room.
      Miss Clarendon felt some difficulty in beginning, but she forced herself
      to repeat all she had heard. Then Lady Davenant started up in her bed, and
      the colour of life spread over her face&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, thank you, Miss Clarendon! a second time I have to thank you
      for an inestimable service. It is well for Cecilia that she made the whole
      truth known to us both&mdash;made you her friend; now we <i>can</i> act
      for her. I will have that locket from Madame de St. Cymon before the sun
      goes down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now Lady Davenant had Madame de St. Cymon completely in her power, from
      her acquaintance with a disgraceful transaction which had come to her
      knowledge at Florence. The locket was surrendered, returned with humble
      assurances that Madame de St. Cymon now perfectly understood the thing in
      its true light, and was quite convinced it had been stolen, not given.
      Lady Davenant glanced over her note with scorn, and was going to throw it
      from her into the fire, but did not. When Miss Clarendon called upon her
      again that evening as she had appointed, she showed it to her, and desired
      that she would, when her brother arrived next day, tell him what she had
      heard, what Lady Davenant had done, and how the locket was now in her
      possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some people who pretend to know, maintain that the passion of love is of
      such an all-engrossing nature that it swallows up every other feeling; but
      we who judge more justly of our kind, hold differently, and rather believe
      that love in generous natures imparts a strengthening power, a magnetic
      touch, to every good feeling. Helen was incapable of being perfectly happy
      while her friend was miserable; and even Beauclerc, in spite of all the
      suffering she had caused, could not help pitying Lady Cecilia, and he
      heartily wished the general could be reconciled to her; yet it was a
      matter in which he could not properly interfere; he did not attempt it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Davenant determined to give a breakfast to all the bridal party after
      the marriage. In her state of health, Helen and Cecilia remonstrated, but
      Lady Davenant had resolved upon it, and at last they agreed it would be
      better than parting at the church-door&mdash;better that she should at her
      own house take leave of Helen and Beauclerc, who would set out immediately
      after the breakfast for Thorndale.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now equipages were finished, and wedding paraphernalia sent home&mdash;the
      second time that wedding-dresses had been furnished for Miss Stanley;&mdash;and
      never once were these looked at by the bride elect, nor even by Cecilia,
      but to see that all was as it should be&mdash;that seen, she sighed, and
      passed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felicie&rsquo;s ecstasies were no more to be heard: we forgot to mention that
      she had, before Helen&rsquo;s return from Llansillen, departed, dismissed in
      disgrace; and happy was it for Lady Cecilia and Helen to be relieved from
      her jabbering, and not exposed to her spying and reporting. Nevertheless,
      the gloom that hung over the world above could not but be observed by the
      world below; it was, however, naturally accounted for by Lady Davenant&rsquo;s
      state of health, and by the anxiety which Lady Cecilia must feel for the
      general, who, as it had been officially announced by Mr. Cockburn, was to
      set out on foreign service the day after the marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Cecilia, notwithstanding the bright hopefulness of her temper, and
      her habits of sanguine belief that all would end well in which she and her
      good fortune had any concern, seemed now, in this respect, to have changed
      her nature; and ever since her husband&rsquo;s denunciations, had continued
      quite resigned to misery, and submissive to the fate which she thought she
      had deserved. She was much employed in attendance upon her mother, and
      thankful that she was so permitted to be. She never mentioned her
      husband&rsquo;s name, and if she alluded to him, or to what had been decreed by
      him, it was with an emotion that scarcely dared to touch the point. She
      spoke most of her child, and seemed to look to the care of him as her only
      consolation. The boy had been brought from Kensington for Lady Davenant to
      see, and was now at her house. Cecilia once said she thought he was very
      like his father, and hoped that he would at least take leave of his boy at
      the last. To that last hour&mdash;that hour when she was to see her
      husband once more, when they were to meet but to part, to meet first at
      the wedding ceremony, and at a breakfast in a public company,&mdash;altogether
      painful as it must be, yet she looked forward to it with a sort of longing
      ardent impatience. &ldquo;True, it will be dreadful, yet still&mdash;still I
      shall see him again, see him once again, and he cannot part with his once
      so dear Cecilia without some word&mdash;some look, different from his
      last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The evening before the day on which the wedding was to be, Lady Cecilia
      was in Lady Davenant&rsquo;s room, sitting beside the bed while her mother
      slept. Suddenly she was startled from her still and ever the same
      recurring train of melancholy thoughts, by a sound which had often made
      her heart beat with joy&mdash;her husband&rsquo;s knock; she ran to the window,
      opened it, and was out on the balcony in an instant. His horse was at the
      door, he had alighted, and was going up the steps; she leaned over the
      rails of the balcony, and as she leaned, a flower she wore broke off&mdash;it
      fell at the general&rsquo;s feet: he looked up, and their eyes met. There he
      stood, waiting on those steps, some minutes, for an answer to his inquiry
      how Lady Davenant was: and when the answer was brought out by Elliott,
      whom, as it seemed, he had desired to see, he remounted his horse, and
      rode away without ever again looking up to the balcony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Davenant had awakened, and when Cecilia returned on hearing her
      voice, her mother, as the light from the half-open shutters shone upon her
      face, saw that she was in tears; she kneeled down by the side of the bed,
      and wept bitterly; she made her mother understand how it had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I hoped more, but still&mdash;still to feel it so! Oh! mother, I
      am bitterly punished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Lady Davenant seizing those clasped hands, and raising herself in her
      bed, fixed her eyes earnestly upon Cecilia, and asked,&mdash;&ldquo;Would you,
      Cecilia&mdash;tell me, would you if it were now, this moment, in your
      power&mdash;would you retract your confession?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Retract! impossible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you repent&mdash;regret having made it, Cecilia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Repent&mdash;regret having made it. No, mother, no!&rdquo; replied Cecilia
      firmly. &ldquo;I only regret that it was not sooner made. Retract!&mdash;impossible
      I could wish to retract the only right thing I have done, the only thing
      that redeems me in my inmost soul from uttermost contempt. No! rather
      would I be as I am, and lose that noble heart, than hold it as I did,
      unworthily. There is, mother, as you said&mdash;as I feel, a sustaining&mdash;a
      redeeming power in truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her mother threw her arms round her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to my heart, my child, close&mdash;close to my heart Heaven bless
      you! You have my blessing&mdash;my thanks, Cecilia. Yes, my thanks,&mdash;for
      now I know&mdash;I feel, my dear daughter, that my neglect of you in
      childhood has been repaired. You make me forgive myself, you make me
      happy, you have my thanks&mdash;my blessing&mdash;my warmest blessing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A smile of delight was on her pale face, and tears ran down as Cecilia
      answered&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, mother, mother! blind that I have been. Why did not I
      sooner know this tenderness of your heart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why, my child, did I not sooner know you? The fault was mine, the
      suffering has been yours,&mdash;not yours alone, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suffer no more for me, mother, for now, after this, come what may, I can
      bear it. I can be happy, even if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; There she paused, and then
      eagerly looking into her mother&rsquo;s eyes she asked,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say, mother, about him? do you think I may hope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare not bid you hope,&rdquo; replied her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you bid me despair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, despair in this world is only for those who have lost their own
      esteem, who have no confidence in themselves, for those who cannot repent,
      reform, and trust. My child, you must not despair. Now leave me to
      myself,&rdquo; continued she &ldquo;Open a little more of the shutter, and put that
      book within my reach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Miss Clarendon heard that her brother had arrived in town she
      hastened to him, and, as Lady Davenant had desired, told him of all the
      reports that were in circulation, and of all that Lady Cecilia had
      spontaneously confided to her. Esther watched his countenance as she
      spoke, and observed that he listened with eager attention to the proofs of
      exactness in Cecilia; but he said nothing, and whatever his feelings were,
      his determination, she could not doubt, was still unshaken; even she did
      not dare to press his confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Clarendon reported to Lady Davenant that she had obeyed her command,
      and she described as nearly as she could all that she thought her
      brother&rsquo;s countenance expressed. Lady Davenant seemed satisfied, and this
      night she slept, as she told Cecilia in the morning, better than she had
      done since she returned to England. And this was the day of trial&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The hour came, and Lady Davenant was in the church with her daughter. This
      marriage was to be, as described in olden times, &ldquo;celebrated with all the
      lustre and pomp imaginable;&rdquo; and so it was, for Helen&rsquo;s sake, Helen, the
      pale bride&mdash;-
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beautiful!&rdquo; the whispers ran as she appeared, &ldquo;but too pale.&rdquo; Leaning on
      General Clarendon&rsquo;s arm she was led up the aisle to the altar. He felt the
      tremor of her arm on his, but she looked composed and almost firm. She saw
      no one individual of the assembled numbers, not even Cecilia or Lady
      Davenant. She knelt at the altar beside him to whom she was to give her
      faith, and General Clarendon, in the face of all the world, proudly gave
      her to his ward, and she, without fear, low and distinctly pronounced the
      sacred vow. And as Helen rose from her knees, the sun shone out, and a ray
      of light was on her face, and it was lovely. Every heart said so&mdash;every
      heart but Lady Katrine Hawksby&rsquo;s&mdash;And why do we think of her at such
      a moment? and why does Lady Davenant think of her at such a moment? Yet
      she did; she looked to see if she were present, and she bade her to the
      breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now all the salutations were given and received, and all the murmur of
      congratulations rising, the living tide poured out of the church; and then
      the noise of carriages, and all drove off to Lady Davenant&rsquo;s; and Lady
      Davenant had gone through it all so far, well. And Lady Cecilia knew that
      it had been; and her eyes had been upon her husband, and her heart had
      been full of another day when she had knelt beside him at the altar. And
      did he, too, think of that day? She could not tell, his countenance
      discovered no emotion, his eyes never once turned to the place where she
      stood. And she was now to see him for one hour, but one hour longer, and
      at a public breakfast! but still she was to see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now they are all at breakfast. The attention of some was upon the
      bride and bridegroom; of others, on Lady Cecilia and on the general; of
      others, on Lady Davenant; and of many, on themselves. Lady Davenant had
      Beauclerc on one side, General Clarendon on the other, and her daughter
      opposite to him. Lady Katrine was there, with her &ldquo;<i>tristeful</i>
      visage,&rdquo; as Churchill justly called it, and more <i>tristeful</i> it
      presently became.
    </p>
    <p>
      When breakfast was over, seizing her moment when conversation flagged, and
      when there was a pause, implying &ldquo;What is to be said or done next?&rdquo; Lady
      Davenant rose from her seat with an air of preparation, and somewhat of
      solemnity.&mdash;All eyes were instantly upon her. She drew out a locket,
      which she held up to public view; then, turning to Lady Katrine Hawksby,
      she said&mdash;&ldquo;This bauble has been much talked of, I understand, by your
      ladyship, but I question whether you have ever yet seen it, or know the
      truth concerning it. This locket was <i>stolen</i> by a worthless man,
      given by him to a worthless woman, from whom I have obtained it; and now I
      give it to the person for whom it was originally destined.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She advanced towards Helen and put it round her neck. This done, her
      colour flitted&mdash;her hand was suddenly pressed to her heart; yet she
      commanded&mdash;absolutely commanded, the paroxysm of pain. The general
      was at her side; her daughter, Helen, and Beauclerc, were close to her
      instantly. She was just able to walk: she slowly left the room&mdash;and
      was no more seen by the world!
    </p>
    <p>
      She suffered herself to be carried up the steps into her own apartment by
      the general, who laid her on the sofa in her dressing-room. She looked
      round on them, and saw that all were there whom she loved; but there was
      an alteration in her appearance which struck them all, and most the
      general, who had least expected it. She held out her hand to him, and
      fixing her eyes upon him with deathful expression, calmly smiled, and said&mdash;&ldquo;You
      would not believe this could be; but now you see it must be, and soon. We
      have no time to lose,&rdquo; continued she, and moving very cautiously and
      feebly, she half-raised herself&mdash;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;a moment is
      granted to me, thank Heaven!&rdquo; She rose with sudden power and threw herself
      on her knees at the general&rsquo;s feet: it was done before he could stop her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;Lady Davenant!&mdash;I conjure you&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She would not be raised. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;here I die if I appeal to you in
      vain&mdash;to your justice, General Clarendon, to which, as far as I know
      none ever appealed in vain&mdash;and shall I be the first?&mdash;a mother
      for her child&mdash;a dying mother for your wife&mdash;for my dear
      Cecilia, once dear to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face was instantly covered with his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to your love,&rdquo; continued she&mdash;&ldquo;if that be gone&mdash;to your
      justice I appeal, and MUST be heard, if you are what I think you: if you
      are not, why, go&mdash;go, instantly&mdash;go, and leave your wife,
      innocent as she is, to be deemed guilty&mdash;Part from her, at the moment
      when the only fault she committed has been repaired&mdash;Throw her from
      you when, by the sacrifice of all that was dear to her, she has proved her
      truth&mdash;Yes, you know that she has spoken the whole, the perfect truth&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; exclaimed he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give her up to the whole world of slanderers!&mdash;destroy her
      character! If now her husband separate from her, her good name is lost for
      ever! If now her husband protect her not&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her husband turned, and clasped her in his arms. Lady Davenant rose and
      blessed him&mdash;blessed them both: they knelt beside her, and she joined
      their hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I give my daughter to a husband worthy of her, and she
      more worthy of that noble heart than when first his. Her only fault was
      mine&mdash;my early neglect: it is repaired&mdash;I die in peace! You make
      my last moments the happiest! Helen, my dearest Helen, now, and not till
      now, happy&mdash;perfectly happy in Love and Truth!&rdquo;

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm<br /><br />Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of<br />electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers<br />including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists<br />because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from<br />people in all walks of life.<br /><br />Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the<br />assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s<br />goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will<br />remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project<br />Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure<br />and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.<br />To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation<br />and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4<br />and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org<br /><br /><br />Section 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg<br />Literary Archive Foundation<br /><br />Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide<br />spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of<br />increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be<br />freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest<br />array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations<br />($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt<br />status with the IRS.<br /><br />The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating<br />charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United<br />States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a<br />considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up<br />with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations<br />where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To<br />SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any<br />particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate<br /><br />While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we<br />have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition<br />against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who<br />approach us with offers to donate.<br /><br />International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make<br />any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from<br />outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.<br /><br />Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation<br />methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other<br />ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.<br />To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate<br /><br /><br />Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic<br />works.<br /><br />Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm<br />concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared<br />with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project<br />Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.<br /><br />Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed<br />editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.<br />unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily<br />keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.<br /><br />Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:<br /><br />     www.gutenberg.org<br /><br />This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,<br />including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary<br />Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to<br />subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.<br /><br /><br /><br /></pre>
